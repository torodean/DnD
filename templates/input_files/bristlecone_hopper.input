Bristlecone Hopper[dnd-info]=A rabbit-sized creature with legs like a grasshopper and a coat of stiff, pine-needle-like fur. It leaps up to 15 feet in a single bound to escape predators, rustling loudly as it goes. Its fur can prick unwary handlers (1 piercing damage on contact), but itâ€™s otherwise docile and feeds on berries.
