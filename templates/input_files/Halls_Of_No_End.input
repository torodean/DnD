Summary[dnd-info]=The Halls Of No End is a simple to setup and solve puzzle. A Map is created with halls that 'never end'. The way this is accomplished is that any hall that appears to end on the map will actually simple lead into another hall. Therefore, anyone within the actual halls would perceive a never ending hallway. For ease of keeping track of which halls connect, either colors can be implemented or different lengths of the hallways. A single hallway with no connection can be added, which is then the exit/escape. This hallway would appear to be a dead end, but upon a brisk walk, you could move right through it.
