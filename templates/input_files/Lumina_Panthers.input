Lumina Panthers[dnd-info]=Panthers with fur that seems to absorb and reflect light in unique ways. They are extremely hard to detect or see when still but can usually be somewhat visible when they are moving through terrain. They are skilled hunters that use their magical camouflage to ambush prey. The patterns on their fur can be harvested to create potent invisibility cloaks.
