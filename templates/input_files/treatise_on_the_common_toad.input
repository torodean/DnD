Treatise On The Common Toad[dnd-info]=A surprisingly heavy volume bound in green cloth, obsessively detailing every aspect of ordinary toads. Its dry prose and excessive diagrams make it a niche item, worth 7 gp to a naturalist.

Summary[dnd-info]=The book catalogs toad species, their habitats, and mating calls with exhaustive precision. A lengthy chapter debates whether toads possess emotions, concluding they are "stoic but misunderstood." "Practical uses" include a dubious recipe for toad-skin boots and a warning against licking them.
