Earning New Gains[dnd-info]=Gains come in the form of points that can be spent on Active Growth Endeavors (see below section). At the end of each session, the DM will decide how many Gains the players receive for that session. These points accumulate over time and can be spent at any point during game downtime. They cannot be spent during gameplay as they represent activities which your character would be spending time to improve upon. You do not have to spend all your Gains and they can be stored or saved for later use.
