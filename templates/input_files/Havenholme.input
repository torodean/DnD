Summary[dnd-info]=Havenholme, also known as Nightstone Isle, stands as a secluded and formidable island situated northwest of Daystone Isle. It is renowned for its discreet operations and controlled environment, functioning as a prison colony under the jurisdiction of the esteemed Daystone royal family. Accessible solely through a southern port, Havenholme is shrouded in an aura of secrecy, with its well-guarded perimeter and vigilant patrols ensuring that its prisoners remain confined within its shores.;The island's topography plays a crucial role in its purpose as a secure penitentiary. The northern and eastern sides of Havenholme are dominated by imposing cliff-faces, their towering presence acting as natural barriers that make escape nearly impossible. These sheer cliffs, carved by the relentless tides and weathered by time, form an impenetrable fortress that discourages even the most determined prisoners from seeking freedom beyond their confines.;Havenholme encompasses diverse areas, each designed to house prisoners based on the severity of their offenses. The prisoners, often individuals from surrounding provinces, are transported to this secluded island to serve their sentences and contribute to the labor-intensive operations that sustain the island and generate income for the Daystone royal family. The prisoners' skills and talents are harnessed for various tasks, such as mining, farming, fishing, weaving, and other trades necessary for the island's self-sufficiency.;Mining operations form a significant component of Havenholme's economic activities. Prisoners toil deep within the island's interior, extracting valuable minerals and resources from the earth. These materials are then transported to the mainland, providing a substantial source of income and wealth for the Daystone royal family. The island's fertile land is also utilized for farming, where prisoners cultivate crops to sustain themselves and contribute to the island's food supply.;In addition to mining and farming, the prisoners of Havenholme are engaged in other trades, such as fishing and weaving. Along the island's rugged coastline, prisoners cast their nets into the bountiful waters, reaping the harvest of the sea. The fruits of their labor are not only essential for sustenance but also serve as a source of income when traded with the mainland. Weaving, too, is a skill practiced by the prisoners, who create intricate textiles and fabrics that are prized for their craftsmanship and sold to discerning buyers beyond Havenholme's shores.;The Daystone royal family plays a central role in the operations of Havenholme, acting as both custodians and beneficiaries of this unique prison colony. They purchase prisoners from surrounding provinces, effectively turning the island's penitentiary system into their primary business venture. The income generated from the prisoners' labor and the sale of goods produced on the island contributes significantly to the wealth and prosperity of the royal family, solidifying their status as influential figures in the region.;Havenholme, with its secluded and controlled environment, serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of transgressions and a means of economic sustenance for the Daystone royal family. While its rugged cliffs and vigilant guards discourage escape attempts, the island remains a place where prisoners, confined and tasked with labor, navigate a world that is both punitive and essential to the prosperity of their captors.
