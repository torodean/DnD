Emberkawa Enclave[dnd-info]=The Emberkawa Enclave is an area of the Ryumon District that is somewhat separated from the rest of the district. It is enclosed by walls on all sides with two large entrances (one to the southeast and one to the southwest). The Enclave is primarily controlled by the Emberkawa Syndicate, who run casino's and other highly profitable businesses within the enclave walls.
