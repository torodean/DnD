Goblet Of Endless Soup[dnd-info]=A dented tin goblet that, once per day, fills with a lukewarm, mildly flavored vegetable soup (enough for one person). The soup is nourishing but leaves the drinker burping loudly every 10 minutes for the next hour, imposing disadvantage on Stealth checks. To activate this goblet, the dented area must be caressed.
