Havenholme Prison Break[dnd-info]=This is a quest which involves freeing a prisoner (Dentin Rues) from Havenholme. This quest is originally part of the "Awaken The Ancient Vister Guardians" quest chain and therefore will have references specific to that. The players are tasked with locating and rescuring Dentin Rues from Havenholme, the prison colony. The place is heavily secured and protected so in order to infiltrate, they are sold as prisoners into the colony. Orbit has an operative working on the inside known as 'The Owl'. The players are to make contact with the owl, find Dentin, and orchistrate an escape. The quest begins with the players receiving their mission while already en route. They are to meet with someone named Commander Ervin who will give them details of the lay of the colony.
