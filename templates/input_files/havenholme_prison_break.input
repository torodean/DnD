Havenholme Prison Break[dnd-info]=This is a quest which involves freeing a prisoner (Dentin Rues) from Havenholme. This quest is originally part of the "Awaken The Ancient Vister Guardians" quest chain and therefore will have references specific to that. The players are tasked with locating and rescuring Dentin Rues from Havenholme, the prison colony. The place is heavily secured and protected so in order to infiltrate, they are sold as prisoners into the colony. Orbit has an operative working on the inside known as 'The Owl'. The players are to make contact with the owl, find Dentin, and orchistrate an escape. The quest begins with the players receiving their mission while already en route. They are to meet with someone named Commander Ervin who will give them details of the lay of the colony. He will explain the layout of Havenholme and show them a map. He will also give them a beacon to activate once they have escaped to be picked up.

Quest Letter[dnd-info]=Orbitees,;;We extend our sincerest congratulations on the successful retrieval of the Book of Artii. The customer is highly satisfied with your work, and we commend you for your dedication and precision in completing the mission. However, there remains a complication.;The information contained within the book is coded, and the only known individual capable of deciphering it is currently imprisoned on Havenholme, the notorious prison colony. Your new mission is to infiltrate Havenholme by posing as prisoners. Once inside, you must locate our operative, known as The Owl. The Owl will guide you in finding a prisoner named Dentin Rues, who is the key to the book's decoding.;After locating Dentin Rues, your objective will shift to orchestrating an escape from the prison. The Owl has been embedded in Havenholme for some time and will assist in your escape plan. Exercise extreme caution, as Havenholme is highly secure, and any misstep could jeopardize the mission. Maintain your cover at all costs, and avoid unnecessary attention.;Commander Ervin is aboard the ship with you and will provide you with further details of the mission. He will brief you on the specifics of your cover identities and entry strategy for Havenholme, as well as key intelligence regarding the prison's layout and security protocols.;We trust your skills will again prove invaluable. Good luck, and ensure Dentin Rues is brought back safely.;~The Commissioner

Havenholme Details[dnd-info]=The players will not be allowed to take their items into Havenholme. Since they will potentially need their items at some point, they have the option to store items in a small pocket dimension within a microcell capsule (a new magic/technology being developed similar to the bag of holding). They will only have one of these and they will also have to hide it well. The best way is under the skin. When entering Havenholme, the players will be scanned for magical auras. To conceal the capsule, a tattoo with magical markings will need to be applied over where the capsule is inserted. The players will be given a ring to wear when entering Havenholme. This ring will alert The Owl to their presence.;When the players enter Havenholme, they will be assigned two guards to monitor them at all times for their first week in the colony. Little do they know, these guards are actually under a secret mission to kill Dentin Ruess, once his identity is uncovered. These guards are informed that these prisoners are Orbit operatives by the colonies Surveillance Mages. The guards are trained insurrectionists and will act dumb and trustworthy in order to gain the trust of the players. These guards will follow them around and even pretent to help them out as if they don't know better.;While the players are searching for Dentin Rues, they will find trouble finding him. The Owl will have no clue where or who he is and will suggest they ask the fellow prisoners to see if they can find any clues. They will, however, find someone who claims to be a fortuneteller or seer named Matilda. Matilda will give the players a book she has written, claiming it to be messages and symbols she saw in her dreams. This book contains the pages required for the Blood Caves Of Havenholme. Entrances to the blood caves exist all over Havenholme, but most are concealed well and the entrances lost with time. These caves are the key to the players escaping.;After acquiring the book from Matilda, a sleezy fella named Jaylen will notice and will come up to the party. He will have overheard them looking for Dentin Rues and claim he knows where he is. He will promise to take the players to him but they have to take him with them. He will do everything to insist that he goes with the players and they may not really have a chance of finding Dentin without him. Little do they know, Jaylen is actually Dentin himself. He is concealing himself because he knows people are after his life and he does not know if he can trust the players. Jaylen will tell the players that Dentin is in the black camp of Havenholme, where only the most dangerous prisoners are taken. The players will have to come up with a plan to make it to the black camp. If they cannot, the guards may be able to assist them. If the players cannot get to the black camp, another route to some Blood cave entrance can be used, but the players will have to be clever in finding out that Jaylen is Dentin.;If the players arrive at black camp, Jaylen will tell them someone else is Dentin to see their reaction. The guards will immidiately attack whoever they learn is Dentin if they believe they have determined who it is. After they attack, the players should try to protect Dentin. After the battle, Jaylen will tell the players that he is actually Dentin, and take them to the Blood Caves Of Havenholme, where they will be lead to potentially escaping.
