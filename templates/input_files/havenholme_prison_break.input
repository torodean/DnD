Havenholme Prison Break[dnd-info]=This is a quest which involves freeing a prisoner (Dentin Rues) from Havenholme. This quest is originally part of the "Awaken The Ancient Vister Guardians" quest chain and therefore will have references specific to that. The players are tasked with locating and rescuring Dentin Rues from Havenholme, the prison colony. The place is heavily secured and protected so in order to infiltrate, they are sold as prisoners into the colony. Orbit has an operative working on the inside known as 'The Owl'. The players are to make contact with the owl, find Dentin, and orchistrate an escape. The quest begins with the players receiving their mission while already en route. They are to meet with someone named Commander Ervin who will give them details of the lay of the colony. He will explain the layout of Havenholme and show them a map.

Havenholme Details[dnd-info]=The players will not be allowed to take their items into Havenholme. Since they will potentially need their items at some point, they have the option to store items in a small pocket dimension within a microcell capsule (a new magic/technology being developed similar to the bag of holding). They will only have one of these and they will also have to hide it well. The best way is under the skin. When entering Havenholme, the players will be scanned for magical auras. To conceal the capsule, a tattoo with magical markings will need to be applied over where the capsule is inserted. The players will be given a ring to wear when entering Havenholme. This ring will alert The Owl to their presence.;When the players enter Havenholme, they will be assigned two guards to monitor them at all times for their first week in the colony. Little do they know, these guards are actually under a secret mission to kill Dentin Ruess, once his identity is uncovered. These guards are informed that these prisoners are Orbit operatives by the colonies Surveillance Mages. The guards are trained insurrectionists and will act dumb and trustworthy in order to gain the trust of the players. These guards will follow them around and even pretent to help them out as if they don't know better.;
