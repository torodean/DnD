The Antianimus Device[dnd-info]=The Antianimus Device is huge ancient device found in a temple on chik'acarka island. This device was created by an ancient Aztec-like civilization that lived thousands of years prior. The civilization practiced spiritual rituals involving the human souls and humanoid sacrifices. They heavily believed in the connections of bloodlines and the power to control entire bloodlines with a great understanding of the physical blood and spiritual soul connections. The Antianimus Device revolves around this philosophy.;This device will transfer a humanoid soul into a limbo-state, where it lives on a different plane of existance in a state of emprisonment. This plane is created within a rare allow of Rhenium, Gold, and Platinum formed into a shell. The outside of the shell is inlaid with many precious gems, which store the physical conciousness of the beings contained within the orb. These orbs are called Tenichean Soul Orbs. The process to create these orbs, however, takes two sacrifices. The first sacrifice has to be of the bloodline that will gain control over the second. The second sacrifice is the bloodline that the first will have control over - both souls will be contained in the product orb. This is the downside of these orbs - they require a sacrifice of your own kin to gain the benefits.;Once created, the Tenichean Soul Orbs must remain in physical contact to the wielder in order to wield their power. The wielder of the orbs must be of the same bloodline of the first sacrifice contained within the orb. If this is the case, the wielder will have complete control of the soul and will of the being contained within the orb (the second sacrifice). In addition, the wielder will have immense control over all decendants of the soul that was sacrificed. Because of the power of these orbs, the The Antianimus Device has been sealed away and hidden throughout the generations.
