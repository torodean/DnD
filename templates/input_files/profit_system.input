P.R.O.F.I.T.S[dnd-info]=In the Passive Returns and Opportunities for Financial Investment and Treasure (P.R.O.F.I.T) System (or simply P.R.O.F.I.T.S for short), characters have the opportunity to engage in various financial endeavors, each tier representing a different level of risk. This system is designed to be straightforward, providing characters with options to pursue low, medium, or high-risk financial activities during campaign downtime.

Low Risk: Stable Employment[dnd-info]=Characters opt for stable employment, taking on a regular job in the city or performing services for a reliable employer. The type of employment can be anything but should be something fitting for the individual character.;-Risk: Low;-Gain: Characters receive a steady income, providing a reliable but moderate financial growth.;-Loss: Minimal, as the stability of the job ensures a consistent income, but the potential for significant wealth accumulation is limited.

Medium Risk: Investment Ventures[dnd-info]=Characters decide to invest their funds in businesses, properties, or ventures that offer potential returns over time.;-Risk: Moderate;-Gain: Medium to high potential returns, with profits increasing as the investment matures.;-Loss: There's a chance of losing a portion or the entirety of the invested capital if the venture faces challenges or fails.

High Risk: Games of Chance and Gambling[dnd-info]=Characters engage in high-stakes games of chance, placing bets or participating in gambling activities.;-Risk: High;-Gain: High potential returns, with the possibility of substantial wealth gained through luck or skill.;-Loss: Significant, as characters risk losing their entire wager or investment in the unpredictable world of gambling.

Financial Growth Mechanics[dnd-info]=At the end of each downtime period, characters declare their chosen financial activity (Low Risk, Medium Risk, or High Risk). The Dungeon Master determines the outcome based on the chosen tier, taking into account the associated risks and potential gains or losses. A dice roll or a predetermined probability can be used to simulate the unpredictability of financial activities, especially in medium and high-risk scenarios. Characters can accumulate wealth over time, and their financial decisions may influence their lifestyle, ability to purchase items, or engage in other significant activities. The Financial Growth System aims to provide a balance between simplicity and engagement, offering characters diverse opportunities to navigate the financial landscape in the campaign.
