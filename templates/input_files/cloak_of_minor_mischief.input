Cloak Of Minor Mischief[dnd-info]=A tattered cloak that allows the wearer to telekinetically move one small, unattended object (up to 1 lb) up to 10 feet once per short rest. The catch: it typically only works if the movement causes a minor inconvenience, like knocking over a cup or nudging a chair out of place. If the user is in a serious situation or trying to do something important, the cloak may fail or behave unexpectedly.
