Amulet Of Awkward Compliments[dnd-info]=A gaudy necklace that, once per day (at a random time), forces the wearer to loudly compliment the nearest creature (friend or foe) in the most awkward way possible (e.g., "Your scales glisten like greasy tavern spoons!"). Grants +1 to Charisma (Persuasion) checks for 1 hour after use, but the complimented creature might react unpredictably.
