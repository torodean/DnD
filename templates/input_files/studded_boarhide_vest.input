Studded Boarhide Vest[dnd-info]=A rugged vest crafted from boar hide, studded with iron rivets for added protection. Grants AC 12 + Dex modifier, weighs 8 lbs, and costs 20 gp. The coarse hide resists wear, doubling the time it takes for the armor to degrade from environmental damage (e.g., rust or rot).
