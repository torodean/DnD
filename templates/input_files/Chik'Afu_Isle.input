Chik'Afu Isle[dnd-info]=Chik'Afu (named after a chicken foot), is one of the unique features of the Da'Chika Isles. It is only considered an island when the land bridge connecting it to Chik'Acarka is submerged during high tides. The area is largely marshland, though it was not always this way. Ancient ruins suggest that Chik'Afu was once a thriving part of the ancient civilization that inhabited the Da'Chika Isles. Chik'Afu's landscape is predominantly marsh, with areas of dense vegetation and scattered ruins from an Aztec-like civilization that existed tens of thousands of years ago. The shifting water levels and swampy terrain make navigation challenging, but also conceal many hidden treasures and secrets. The marshland is teeming with unique flora and fauna, as well as remnants of ancient structures.
