Da'Chika Isles[dnd-info]=The Da'Chika Isles are an island chain off the coast of Visterguard. The island chain was named after the various parts of a chicken. This is because a rare creature evolved on these islands which resembles that of a chicken and a mini T-rex combined (this was the original form of the Umbradraconis Brastryx). The island chain consists of nine islands as well as one hidden island that sunk many years ago.

The Nine Da'Chika Islands[dnd-list]=Chik'Afu (named after a chicken foot);Chik'Awii (named after a chicken wing);Chik'Acarka (named after a chicken carcus);Chik'Ahir (named after a chicken heart);Chik'Ako (named after a chicken comb);Chik'Anik (named after a chicken neck);Chik'Ami (named after chicken meat);Chik'Alig (named after achicken leg);Chik'Atida (named after a chicken tender)

Chik'Apoo Island[dnd-info]=Chik'Apoo Island (named after chicken poo) was another island in the Da'Chika Isles chain that has long since sunk. This island has a huge number of ancient ruins from a civilization that lived on these islands a long time ago. This island sank such a long time ago that all modern maps do not include this island. The only references to this island are within ruins and ancient temples on the other island.
