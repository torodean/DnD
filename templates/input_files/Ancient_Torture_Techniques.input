Ancient Torture Techniques[dnd-info]=Ancient Torture Techniques is a novel by Freudon Leuro, a wizard who lived a few centuries prior. Some notable sections follow.

Torture In Simplicity[dnd-info]=Many years ago there was a grand wizard Eliv Prophena who was a master of finding masterful solutions to problems using extremely simplistic ideas. With respect to the concept of torture, he invented 13 rings which enhanced the bodies own sensations as teh perfect form of torture. These rings are perfectly unique and have never been successfully duplicated (as far as the author of this book is aware). Posession of one of these rings would bring great wealth to the bearer. Each ring enhances a specific sensation which increases over time, while acting as a double edged sword.;*Ring of Amber Water*This ring makes the wearer feel like they have to pee, but the wearer can never pee.;*Ring of Ruby Swelling*This ring gives the wearer a migraine which continually increases in intensity.;*Ring of Citrine Flame*This ring makes the wearer feel an intense heat, but they cannot cool down.;*Ring of Sapphire Frost*This ring makes the wearer feel extremely cold, but they cannot warm up.;*Ring of Garnet Thirst*This ring makes the wearer feel incredibly thirsty, but no amount of drinking can quench their thirst.;*Ring of Emerald Hunger*This ring makes the wearer feel ravenously hungry, but they can never feel satiated.;*Ring of Onyx Breath*This ring makes the wearer feel as if they are suffocating, but they can never catch their breath.;*Ring of Topaz Echo*This ring causes a constant, irritating noise in the wearer's ears that they cannot escape from.;*Ring of Amethyst Tremor*This ring makes the wearer feel an unending sense of vertigo, as if they are constantly falling or spinning.;*Ring of Obsidian Itch*This ring causes an insatiable itch all over the wearer's body that cannot be relieved.;*Ring of Silver Silence*This ring causes the wearer to experience absolute silence (even from their own heartbeat).;*Ring of Quartz Wakefulness*This ring makes the wearer feel perpetually sleepy, but unable to sleep or find rest.;*Ring of Peridot Pressure*This ring makes the wearer feel an intense pressure on their sinuses, causing the feeling of having to sneeze but never being able to.;In the annals of history, there have been accounts of individuals who attempted to master the Rings of Eliv Prophena. These trials were harrowing, with each bearer experiencing the height of their respective torment. Notable among these accounts is the tale of Sir Belwin, a knight who sought to prove his endurance by wearing the Ring of Obsidian Itch. He lasted a mere three days before succumbing to the overwhelming urge to begin biting at his own skin with his teeth. His story serves as a stark reminder of the insidious nature of these rings.

Psychological Terrors[dnd-info]=Physical pain is not the only method of torture; psychological torment can be equally, if not more, effective. Techniques designed to break the mind and spirit were employed by some of the most sinister minds in history.;*Isolation Chambers: Victims were placed in complete darkness and silence for extended periods, leading to hallucinations, paranoia, and eventual mental breakdown.;*Mock Executions*The victim is led to believe they are about to be executed, only for the execution to be halted at the last moment. This process is repeated to instill constant fear and anxiety.;*Water Torture*Also known as Chinese water torture, a steady drip of water onto the victim's forehead drives them to madness over time.;*Sleep Deprivation*Preventing the victim from sleeping, causing severe cognitive impairment, hallucinations, and eventual psychological collapse.;*Sensory Deprivation*Placing the victim in an environment where they cannot see, hear, or feel anything, leading to disorientation and mental breakdown.;These devices and techniques are a testament to the dark ingenuity of torturers throughout history, each designed to break the will and spirit of their victims in the most excruciating ways possible.
