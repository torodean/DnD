Awaken The Ancient Vister Guardians[dnd-info]=This is a chain of one-shot quests that can be done using the Orbit System. The premise of the story lies within the walls of the great city of Suren. These walls were constructed thousands of years prior and are comprised of dormant Stone Giants (Ancient Vister Guardians). The power to wield these giants was lost with time but is slowly being uncovered by 'the customer' (as the players will hear them referenced). The power of these stone giants lay with the control and acquisition of eight Tenichean Soul Orbs, which is the goal of 'the customer' (someone who already has collected some of the orbs).

Zaubergrube Arena[dnd-info]=The first quest in the series is the Zaubergrube Arena. The Orbit employees (the players) are sent into this arena by request of 'the customer' in order to test their skills and see if they could be up to the challenge of some more important or difficult tasks. The important part here is that the customer will learn that the players will stick around through dangerous challenges and not turn their back on their Orbit commitment.

Retreiving The Book Of Artifacts[dnd-info]=The second quest in the series is Retreiving a book of artifacts. This quest involves traveling to Vifavea, finding the wizard Milton Manastorm, discovering the hidden basement under the mansion, and retreiving the "Book of Artii". This book is a book of ancient artifacts which has information on some of the artifacts that 'the customer' is interested in. 

Retreiving the Tenichean Orb[dnd-info]=The third quest in the series is Retreiving the Tenichean Orb, which involves the players hunting down and retreiving a stolen Tenichean Orb. This orb ws stolen and it is up to the players to retreive it at all cost. The players will have to follow clues and navigate the city of Suren to uncover and confront the thieves.

Havenholme Prison Break[dnd-info]=The fourth quest in the series is Havenholme Prison Break, which involves the players breaking someone out of the prison colony of Havenholme. This person has vital information that 'the customer' is interested in for their goals.

Tinker Zepplin Sabotage[dnd-info]=The fifth quest in the series is Tinker Zepplin Sabotage, which involves the players delivering a package to a far away land. The players will travel via a new Zepplin system that is being installed. This mission is time sensitive and little do the players know, the package they are delivering is a vital component to 'the customer's' goals. 

Destroying The Antianimus Machine[dnd-info]=The sixth quest in the series is Destroying The Antianimus Machine. This quest involves the players tracking down and destroying an ancient device known as the Antianimus Machine. This device is important to 'the customer' in the sense that it could harm the goals of the customer. Therefore, they want it destroyed and will leave it up to the players to do so.
