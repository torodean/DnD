Codex Of Forgotten Recipes[dnd-info]=A thick, grease-stained tome bound in cracked leather, containing recipes for bizarre dishes from a bygone era. Its faded ink and odd ingredients make it a curiosity worth 10 gp to a chef or historian.

Summary[dnd-info]=The book lists meals like "stewed eel with honey glaze" and "roasted cave beetle pie," with detailed instructions.;Many ingredients, such as "duskoroot" or "glimmerfish," are extinct or unknown, rendering most recipes impractical.;A few legible pages offer tips on preserving meat that could still be useful to an adventurous cook.
