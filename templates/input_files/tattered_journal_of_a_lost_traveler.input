Tattered Journal Of A Lost Traveler[dnd-info]=A weathered leather journal filled with frantic scribbles and crude maps, chronicling a wandererâ€™s descent into madness while exploring uncharted lands. The pages are stained and brittle, worth 5 gp to a collector of oddities.

Summary[dnd-info]=The journal begins with optimistic notes about a journey into a dense, unnamed forest, complete with sketches of strange plants.;As pages progress, the tone shifts to paranoia, describing unseen watchers and eerie noises.;The final entries are incoherent ramblings about a "shining cave" that the author never found, ending mid-sentence.
