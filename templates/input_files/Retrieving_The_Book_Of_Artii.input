Retrieving The Book Of Artii[dnd-info]=This quest involves the task of retrieving the Book of Artii. The book's exact location is unknown. A powerful but mischievous wizard named Milton Manastorm was initially assigned to retrieve it. Milton managed to track the book to Vifavea, but communication with him was lost shortly after. Milton found himself in a jail cell after causing trouble. The players are now tasked with traveling to Vifavea to find Milton Manastorm and acquire the Book of Artii. Before his capture, Milton had arranged to receive the book from his contact at The Salty Seahorse Inn. However, he was ambushed just outside the inn by members of The Council of Shadows, who took the book. In the chaos, Milton caused quite a bit of damage to the Inn - which is what landed him in jail. Milton, knowledgeable about The Council of Shadows, is aware that they have a hidden underground base beneath the Vifavea Mansion. He does not know how to access this base. The players must infiltrate this base and retrieve the Book of Artii.

By-Letter Quest Start[dnd-info]=One option for how the quest can begin is via a letter. The players recieved an urgent request to mee at the docks of the town they are in, with little other information but to bring their usual equipment. At the docks, the players receive a letter outlining their mission.;"This letter serves as your official assignment regarding the urgent retrieval of the Book of Artii. Your primary objective is to locate and retrieve this book at the request of a customer.;The wizard Milton Manastorm was tasked with obtaining the book and was last known to be in Vifavea, where he had located its whereabouts. At that time, he was staying at the Salty SeaHorse Inn. Milton was scheduled to return with the book yesterday, but he has not reported back. His last communication was received two days ago, and he has since failed to provide his regular daily updates via hawkmail. Given Milton's chaotic nature, his failure to report is still a significant concern.;You are instructed to travel to the city of Vifavea immediately. Once there, locate the Salty SeaHorse Inn where Milton was last known to be staying. Investigate the circumstances surrounding his disappearance and ascertain the current status of the Book of Artii. If possible, retrieve the book and report back with your findings. Please note that Milton’s usual communication method is via hawkmail, and his silence is unusual, warranting immediate action. Be prepared for potential complications or hazards, as the circumstances of Milton’s absence are unknown. Do not assume that Milton is still an ally - as we are unaware of his status.;We trust in your capability to handle this mission with the urgency and professionalism required. Your prompt action is essential to ensure the success of this critical task. Do not raise any uneccesary attention and Good luck."
