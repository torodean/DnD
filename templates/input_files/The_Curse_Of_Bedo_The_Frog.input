The Lair Of Bedo, The Frog[dnd-info]=Deep within the heart of a forest lies an ancient tree, its gnarled roots forming around a small door. Behind this door, within the hollowed trunk, resides an unexpected and magical inhabitant named Bedo—a small, emerald-green frog with gleaming eyes that seem to possess a wisdom beyond its form. The frog guards a modest pile of gold pieces, an oddity in this lush, mystical realm.;Upon locating the ancient tree, the adventurers find a large, gnarled root that appears to have grown into a door. A soft, mossy path leads to this hidden entrance, revealing the doorway into the hollowed interior of the tree. A faint, warm light emanates from within, casting gentle shadows on the forest floor. As the door creaks open, the adventurers are met with the sight of a small, cozy interior. Moss-covered walls curve around to form a protective alcove, and nestled within is the emerald-green guardian Bedo. Its eyes shine with an otherworldly intelligence, and in front of it rests a small pile of gold pieces, each coin glinting in the warm glow. Should any member of the party attempt to take a coin from the hoard, the guardian Bedo croaks a soft warning, its voice carrying an air of solemnity. Should the warning be ignored and the gold piece taken, a curse is triggered

The Curse Of Bedo, The Frog[dnd-info]=The moment the cursed gold is removed from the pile, the thief is marked by the curse. Subtle changes begin to take place within the individual's surroundings—a chill in the air, shadows that seem to stretch unnaturally, and a lingering sense of being watched. Over time, these effects escalate, causing discomfort and unease. As the curse deepens, the cursed individual experiences vivid dreams in which they are pursued by shadowy figures, an eerie reflection of the frog's own guardian nature. The dreams become increasingly distressing, leaving the afflicted in a state of perpetual exhaustion and paranoia.;To break the curse, the adventurer must return the stolen gold piece to the frog's hoard and offer a sincere apology. Bedo, as a guardian of balance, will accept the offering and lift the curse, bringing an end to the haunting dreams and unsettling sensations. The encounter with the Guardian Bedo's Hoard presents adventurers with a choice: to heed the tales and respect the guardian's role, or to yield to greed and face the consequences of a curse that reflects the disturbance of the forest's natural harmony.

Alternative Redemption: The Harmony of Restoration[dnd-info]=For those who possess a deep connection to the natural world and are attuned to the subtle rhythms of life, an alternative path to breaking the curse emerges. As the cursed individual delves into the forest's mysteries, they uncover ancient tales and forgotten rituals that speak of the guardian frog's role as a protector of balance.;To break the curse through this alternative redemption, the cursed must seek out a hidden glade deep within the heart of the enchanted forest. This glade is a place of untouched beauty, where the energies of nature converge in harmony. There, under the light of a full moon, the cursed must offer an act of restitution that restores balance to the forest. The specific act varies depending on the circumstances, but it often involves nurturing a struggling plant back to life, reuniting a lost woodland creature with its family, or cleansing a tainted stream with a mixture of rare herbs. The key lies in demonstrating a true understanding of the guardian frog's role as a protector of the forest's equilibrium. Upon the successful completion of the restorative act, the curse begins to unravel. The chilling air eases, the shadows recede, and the dreams of pursuit fade away. The forest seems to sigh in relief, and a sense of connection to the natural world deepens within the redeemed individual.;This alternative path to breaking the curse emphasizes the importance of respecting the guardian frog's purpose and the delicate balance of the enchanted forest. It encourages adventurers to see beyond their own desires and connect with the intrinsic harmony of the world around them—a lesson that goes beyond material wealth and serves as a reminder of the interwoven web of life that binds all creatures in the realm.

Alternate Consequential Sequence[dnd-info]=As the party successfully acquires Bedo the frog's coveted treasure, they resume their journey with a sense of triumph and newfound wealth. However, their elation soon gives way to a creeping unease as a series of inexplicable and eerie events begin to unfold. It becomes increasingly apparent that they are ensnared by a malevolent magical curse, and the spectral presence of Bedo appears to haunt them from beyond the grave. At first, these spectral interactions are subtle and disconcerting. Members of the party begin to experience haunting nightmares, vivid and terrifying visions of their past misdeeds, and strange voices whispering unsettling secrets in their ears. Sleep becomes a precious commodity, as the party members find themselves unable to rest peacefully. They begin to see fleeting glimpses of Bedo's spectral form, lurking in shadows or reflected in murky waters, always just out of reach.;As time progresses, the haunting intensifies. The party members are plagued by relentless insomnia, their fatigue mounting as they struggle to differentiate reality from illusion. Whispered secrets escalate into chilling threats, and some begin to doubt the loyalty of their companions. Paranoia festers, trust erodes, and a sinister wedge is driven between them. The culmination of these supernatural terrors arrives when the party's sanity starts to unravel. The members, tormented beyond their limits, turn on one another in fits of hysteria, their once unbreakable bonds shattering. In their madness, they become instruments of their own demise.;As the last echoes of their desperate struggles fade away, the party members awaken with their outstretched hands inches from Bedo's coveted hoard of gold. Bedo the frog, no longer a specter, stands guard over the gleaming pile. It was all a vivid and harrowing vision—a haunting lesson delivered by the vengeful spirit of Bedo to show them the dire consequences of their avarice and betrayal. With trembling hearts and newfound wisdom, the party members realize the true cost of their actions and the importance of the choices they make on their journey. The gold gleams before them, a tantalizing temptation, but they now understand that the true treasure lies in the bonds of friendship and the path of righteousness they must follow.
