Velvetine Sandlizard[dnd-info]=A foot-long lizard with a coat of velvety, sand-colored fuzz instead of scales, found in deserts. It burrows into dunes and vibrates its body to create a low hum, warding off rivals. Non-aggressive, it bites only if cornered (1d4 piercing damage), preferring to flee by tunneling.
