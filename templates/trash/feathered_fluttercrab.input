Feathered Fluttercrab[dnd-info]=A small, crab-like creature with a hard shell covered in soft, iridescent feathers instead of spines. About the size of a fist, it scuttles along coastlines and can glide short distances (up to 10 feet) using its feather-fans when startled. Harmless but territorial, it snaps its tiny claws (1 bludgeoning damage) if threatened.
