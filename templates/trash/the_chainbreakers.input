Overview[dnd-info]=The Chainbreakers are a defiant gang of prisoners scattered across Havenholme’s labor camps, united by a burning hatred for the Daystone royal family and a desperate dream of escape. Formed in the shadows of the island’s mines and fields, they’re a mix of hardened criminals and wronged souls who see their confinement as a temporary setback rather than a life sentence. Their name is a whispered rallying cry among the oppressed, though their bold talk of freedom is tempered by the reality of Havenholme’s cliffs and watchful guards. They clash often with the Sallow Hands, a rival gang they accuse of snitching to the guards for scraps of favor.

Key Members[dnd-list]=Dren (Ironlung) Vask: A grizzled dwarf miner from the Red Camp, leading with a gravelly voice and unyielding resolve.;Lirra Quickblade: A nimble human thief from the Yellow Camp, skilled with a shiv and a knack for picking locks.;Torvax Greymane: An older orc farmer from the Green Camp, whose quiet strength hides a cunning mind.;Selene Duskwind: A half-elf weaver from the Orange Camp, weaving coded messages into her textiles.

Operations[dnd-info]=The Chainbreakers survive and scheme within Havenholme’s rigid system, always probing for a way out.;-They smuggle tools and shivs between camps, trading stolen mining picks for fish or cloth.;-They sabotage mining quotas in the Red Camp to disrupt the Daystone’s profits, hoping to spark chaos.;-They bribe Blue Camp laborers with hoarded rations to carry messages or look the other way.;-They scout the northern cliffs for weak points, despite the Watch Commanders’ scrying eyes.;Their biggest move was a failed breakout from the Orange Camp, thwarted when the Sallow Hands tipped off the Insurrectionists, earning them a blood feud that still simmers.
