Contents[dnd-info]=Dear Lady Isabella,;I hope this letter finds you in the best of health and spirits. Allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude for the timely delivery of the herbs you sent for my ailing uncle. The potion brewed from them seems to have brought him back from the brink, and he now insists on challenging the stableboy to a race around the courtyard. I must admit, I haven't seen him this lively since the incident with the mischievous goat last summer.;In matters less goat-related, I have some exciting news to share. The Council of Elders has convened to discuss the upcoming trade negotiations with the merchants from Bakaria. As you know, these discussions have been as slow as a snail in molasses, but rumor has it that the Bakarian envoy has a fondness for peculiar headwear. I dare say I've been practicing my collection of rare hats to ensure our negotiations are on the winning end of eccentricity.;On a more serious note, it seems that our resident bard, Tavish, has composed a new ballad. This time, he's taken inspiration from the comical incident involving the mayor's prized rooster and the visiting dignitaries. I'm told it's already the talk of the town, and the mayor's face has turned a shade of red that rivals the sunset over the Riava Plateau.;In matters of the heart, I must confess that my affections for you have grown stronger with each passing day. Just the other evening, I saw a shooting star streak across the night sky and couldn't help but wish for your laughter to fill the air like the melodies of the Matellan markets. If only the stars had a better sense of timing, they would have waited until after I finished my dramatic soliloquy.;Before I sign off, I wanted to extend an invitation to you. The annual Harvest Festival is approaching, and I believe a certain someone would look positively radiant wearing a crown of autumn leaves. The villagers are eagerly anticipating your presence, and the local florist has been practicing her leaf arranging techniques in preparation.;In anticipation of your response, I remain yours in excitement and unexpected turnips,;Lord Alistair;P.S. Please let your messenger know that my cousin's goat has gone missing again. If he happens upon it, tell him it answers to the name Sir Bleats-a-Lot and enjoys reciting poetry under the moonlight.
