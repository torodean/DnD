Overview[dnd-info]=The Sallow Hands are a cunning gang of prisoners who thrive by playing Havenholme’s system to their advantage, trading loyalty to the guards for small comforts in their bleak existence. Named for the pale, grime-streaked hands of their members—many of whom work the mines or fields—they’re a pragmatic lot who see rebellion as a fool’s errand on an island ringed by cliffs and sea. They’ve carved out a niche as informants and enforcers, despised by the Chainbreakers for their willingness to sell out fellow prisoners. Their uneasy alliance with the guards keeps them alive, but it’s a fragile thread that could snap if their usefulness wanes.

Key Members[dnd-list]=Kael (Whisper) Torne: A sly human from the Blue Camp, leading with a silver tongue and ears everywhere.;Veyna Blackthorn: A fierce tiefling miner from the Black Camp, enforcing the gang’s will with a cold stare.;Ruk Mudfoot: A goblin from the Green Camp, skilled at fishing and sniffing out secrets.;Jessa Flint: A human from the Yellow Camp, whose sharp memory tracks debts and favors owed.
