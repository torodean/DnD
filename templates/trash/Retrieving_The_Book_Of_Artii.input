Retrieving The Book Of Artii[dnd-info]=This quest involves the task of retrieving the Book of Artii. The book's exact location is unknown. A powerful but mischievous wizard named Milton Manastorm was initially assigned to retrieve it. Milton managed to track the book to Vifavea, but communication with him was lost shortly after. Milton found himself in a jail cell after causing trouble. The players are now tasked with traveling to Vifavea to find Milton Manastorm and acquire the Book of Artii. Before his capture, Milton had arranged to receive the book from his contact at The Salty Seahorse Inn. However, he was ambushed just outside the inn by members of The Council of Shadows, who took the book. In the chaos, Milton caused quite a bit of damage to the Inn - which is what landed him in jail. Milton, knowledgeable about The Council of Shadows, is aware that they have a hidden underground base beneath the Vifavea Mansion. He does not know how to access this base. The players must infiltrate this base and retrieve the Book of Artii.
