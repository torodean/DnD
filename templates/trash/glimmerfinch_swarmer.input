Glimmerfinch Swarmer[dnd-info]=A tiny, bird-like creature with translucent, shimmering wings and a body no bigger than a walnut. It travels in flocks of 5-10, creating a dazzling display as they flit through trees. They peck at insects (no damage to larger creatures) and scatter in a burst of light when threatened.
