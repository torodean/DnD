Summary[dnd-info]=As your brave adventurers tread further into the depths of wherever they are, they come across a long and dimly lit corridor. At the end of this corridor, an intriguing sight greets their eyes â€“ a set of intricate illusionary bars, separating them from a massive and fearsome illusionary Manticore. The creature's menacing roars echo off the walls, adding an air of tension to the scene. Curiously, right in front of the illusionary bars is a peculiar teleportation circle etched onto the floor. It's adorned with ancient runes and emanates an otherworldly energy. This teleporter appears to be programmed to transport small objects  from its location to a corresponding point behind the adventurers at the other side of the hall. In between the two teleporters is a numbing zone, where pain cannotbe felt. The Illusionary Menagerie Trap challenges your players to think critically and consider their actions wisely. Shooting arrows at the illusionary Manticore is a natural response, and indeed, their arrow shots sail through the illusionary bars without obstruction. With enough time and arrows, they might even manage to "defeat" the illusionary creature. However, the arrows will be teleported to behind the party, causing all the potential damage done to them.
