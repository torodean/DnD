Zentikis[dnd-info]=The Zentikis are a race of small humanoid creatures. They developed their small stature over many years. It initially started as a byproduct of the nearby Moonstone Fruits their ancestors ate, but they have adapted to be naturally small through breeding afterwards. The Zentikis are primarily hunter-gatherers who heavily rely on their natural surroundings for any magic and defenses. They wear tiki-like masks and usually have spears and small shields on hand. They travel in groups and always stay in groups. These small creatures form small villages where they have tends and huts build into their surroundings.
