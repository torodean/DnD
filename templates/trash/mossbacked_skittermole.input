Mossbacked Skittermole[dnd-info]=A mole-like critter with a back covered in thick, living moss that blends into forest floors. Roughly 8 inches long, it digs shallow tunnels and emits a faint, earthy scent to attract mates. Itâ€™s skittish but curious, nibbling on roots and leaving behind trails of loose soil (no combat ability).
