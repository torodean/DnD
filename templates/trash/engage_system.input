E.N.G.A.G.E. System[dnd-info]=The Earning New Gains through Active Growth Endeavors (E.N.G.A.G.E.) System is designed to infuse character progression with dynamic and active elements, allowing players to shape their characters through earned gains achieved via active growth endeavors that the characters live during game downtime. In this system, characters accumulate 'Gains' through successful sessions, missions, creative role-playing, and personal accomplishments. At the end of each session, players are rewarded with Gains, reflective of their active engagement and achievements. These points can be strategically allocated across various categories, such as leveling up, acquiring new skills, enhancing attributes, or unlocking special abilities.;The core philosophy of the system is the name of the system "Earning New Gains through Active Growth Endeavors," emphasizing that character development is not solely a passive process but a reflection of the character's active engagement and contributions to the unfolding narrative. Whether through mastering new skills, leveling up, or unlocking unique abilities, players have the agency to actively shape the trajectory of their characters' growth. Additionally, the E.N.G.A.G.E. System encourages players to participate actively in downtime activities, training, and quests, creating a synergistic relationship between in-game actions and character advancement. This dynamic approach ensures that characters evolve organically, reflecting the choices, actions, and endeavors of the players as they navigate the rich and immersive world of the campaign.

Earning New Gains[dnd-info]=Gains come in the form of points that can be spent on Active Growth Endeavors (see below section). At the end of each session, the DM will decide how many Gains the players receive for that session. These points accumulate over time and can be spent at any point during game downtime. They cannot be spent during gameplay as they represent activities which your character would be spending time to improve upon. You do not have to spend all your Gains and they can be stored or saved for later use.

Active Growth Endeavors[dnd-info]=These are all the endeavors that your character can be working on during game downtime. If they choose, they can spend their time learning a new language, studying, learning new skills, or more. Different tasks take varying amounts of work. The "Spending Gains" Chart below shows how many points it takes for each form of growth.

Further Details On Gains Spent[dnd-list]=Crafting a basic item - This can be any basic item (weapons, armor, clothes, trinkets, etc) commonly found in the area of the players with any customization options desired by the players (color, engraving, style). This item can be customized to include special or magical characteristics if the player has other items (which would be destroyed in the process) that already contain these characteristics. For example, if the player has a magical sword which adds +1 to strength, they can create another sword with any custom look which also has +1 to strength (destroying the original in the process).;Crafting a masterwork item  - The player can create an item with a stat bonus (determined by the DM).;Starting a small business venture - The player must have (or be able to buy/learn) the appropriate tools and skills necessary for some sort of small business. The player can start this business and run it during game downtime. This business gives the player an advantage when conducting normal profit system calculations. If the player has this they gain one of the following affects when the profit system takes effect: +3 gold to a low-risk growth, +2 to the medium-risk dice roll, or +10% (ADD 10%) change to a high-risk investment outcome (i.e. if you roll a 20, this becomes 510% instead of 500%). This affect is multiplied for each time the player purchases this gain (i.e if the player purchase it 3 times, they would receive +9 gold to low-risk, +6 to medium-risk, or +30% to high-risk).
