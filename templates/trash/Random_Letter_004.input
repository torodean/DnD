Contents[dnd-info]=Dear Kaely,;I write to you with a sense of somber resolution, as it has become evident that our paths must diverge. Regrettably, I have come to the decision to release you from your role as my apprentice. It is my responsibility to recognize where potential thrives, and in this instance, I acknowledge that my discernment faltered. Please understand that even the most accomplished of mages, myself included, can falter in judgment. This decision is borne from a place of genuine concern for your growth.;May you find solace in embarking upon a journey aligned with your true strengths. It may be that a pursuit more suited to your talents presents itself â€“ perhaps something as intricate and purposeful as basket weaving. Indeed, sometimes the winding paths of life lead us to unexpected crafts.;While I am unable to personally recommend a specific guild of basket weavers, rest assured that you will not bear a lack of opportunities in your transition. As the demands of my own pursuits occupy much of my time, I regret that I am unable to pen a formal recommendation for your endeavors.;I urge you to return to Tempestas at your earliest convenience. Should you require any guidance or assistance during your transition, my doors remain open to you. Your time as my apprentice, though short, has undoubtedly contributed to your journey of self-discovery.;Wishing you clarity and determination in the chapters that await you,;Gilbhert
