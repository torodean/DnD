Contents[dnd-info]=My Dearest Valerina,;I hope this letter finds you in good spirits and not too bothered by my sudden urge to write. You see, I've been contemplating the most peculiar thoughts lately, and it occurred to me that I might need to put these thoughts onto paper. So here I am, with a pen in hand and a heart that's doing its best to not leap out of my chest.;You know, I've always found your presence to be rather... well, it's hard to put into words. Let's just say that whenever you're around, my words tend to get tangled up like a kitten in a ball of yarn. I'm not sure if it's the way your eyes twinkle like stars on a clear night or how your laughter feels like a warm hug on a chilly day, but there's something about you that makes me want to find a rock to hide under.;I've noticed that when you're near, my sentences tend to veer off course like a ship without a compass. I'll start talking about the weather, and before I know it, I'm discussing the philosophical implications of clouds. It's as if my brain gets so dazzled by your presence that it forgets how to steer the conversational ship.;But I digress. What I really wanted to say is that I find you incredibly fascinating and utterly bewildering in the best possible way. And while my words might stumble and falter, please know that my intentions are as clear as a puddle after a rainstorm.;If you'd be willing to tolerate my awkwardness, I'd be over the moon to spend more time in your company. Maybe we could grab a cup of coffee (or tea, if you prefer) and share some of the most delightfully clumsy conversations the world has ever seen.;Until then, please excuse my stumbling prose and accept this letter as a humble attempt to convey a sentiment that words seem to inadequately capture.;Yours in awkward admiration,;Stephan
