Mist Veil Ferns[dnd-info]=Ferns that release a magical mist when disturbed. The mist can obscure vision and create illusions, making it a valuable resource for illusionists and tricksters. The released mist typically forms into predators or other creatures found in the nearby environment. In some jungle regions, this mist causes travelers to see many abberations of beasts that are not actually there - making actual beasts and creatures much more dangerous.
