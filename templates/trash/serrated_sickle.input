Serrated Sickle[dnd-info]=A farmer’s sickle with a jagged, saw-like edge along its curved blade. Deals 1d4 slashing damage and can be used to cut through light foliage or rope with ease (no mechanical bonus, just flavor). Its utilitarian design keeps it affordable at 1 gp, though it’s less effective against armor.
