    Description
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    Goodest Berry is a conjuration spell that allows the caster to magically modify a handful of ordinary berries. These berries hold a hidden potential for extraordinary benefits but only when and after consumed by a canine or dog-like creature such as a dog, wolf, or similar creature. When casting the spell, the caster creates a number of berries equal to 1d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier. These berries have a duration of 24 hours. While they appear ordinary to the naked eye, they contain magical essence that activates upon being consumed and digested by a canine creature. When a canine creature eats one of these berries, it gains the following benefits:
   </p>
   <p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Healing: The creature regains 1 hit point.
     </li>
     <li>
      Enhanced Senses: The creature's sense of smell becomes highly attuned, granting advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell for the next hour.
     </li>
     <li>
      Energizing Effect: The creature gains temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
    Swift Movements: The creature's base movement speed increases by 10 feet for the next minute.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's important to note that the immediate benefits of the Goodest Berry spell can only be experienced by canine creatures. If a non-canine creature or humanoid consumes the berries, they will provide no additional benefits beyond basic nutrition.
   </p>
   <p>
    In addition to these benefits, if a humanoid creature consumes a Goodest Berry that has been previously digested by a canine creature, they can gain a unique benefit as well. The exact benefit is determined by the type of canine creature that originally digested the berry as well as the type of berry use in the spell. The possible additional benefits include:
   </p>
   <p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Canine Instinct: The humanoid gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell for the next hour.
     </li>
     <li>
      Feral Agility: The humanoid's Dexterity score increases by 2 for the next hour.
     </li>
     <li>
      Pack Mentality: The humanoid gains advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks when dealing with canines for the next hour.
     </li>
     <li>
      Lupine Resilience: The humanoid gains resistance to nonmagical piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage for the next hour.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
    The additional benefits of digested Goodest Berries provide a unique advantage to humanoid characters, offering a temporary connection to the canine instincts and traits associated with the original consumer and goodberry effects. However, it's important to note that the effects are temporary and last for only one hour. The digested goodberries are not entirely stable and may have random other improved effects or negative side ffects.
