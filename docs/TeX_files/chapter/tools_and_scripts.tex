\chapter{Tools And Scripts}


















\section{mmorpdnd.py}

\subsection{Purpose}

This script serves as the backbone for an array of automatic linking and logistical features within MMORPDND. These functionalities typically operate on all files, encompassing crucial elements such as the generation of directories, HTML index files at the directory summits, establishment of uniform headers and navigation for all HTML documents, seamless interlinking between files, refinement of both HTML and CSS code, and an array of additional capabilities. When ran, this script will perform the following actions in the following order:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create Directory Structures if not already existing.
	\item Create index files for each directory.
	\item Update each index file to link to all files and images within the directory.
	\item Update the headers of all html files to the template html header.
	\item Update the navigation of all html files to the template navigation html.
	\item Search and hyperlink all words found in all html files to the appropriate html file whose name matches the words found.
	\item Beautify the code.
\end{enumerate}







\subsection{Use}

The mmorpdnd.py script can be ran as a gui window or using the command line options. The two main features are `test' and `update'. The `test' feature will create fake files and then perform the update command on them. This is useful for testing if the features and newly added features are working properly. The `update' feature will perform a combination of tasks which updates all appropriate files to do the steps mentioned in the list above.

\subsubsection{GUI}

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/mmorpdnd_gui.png}
	\caption{The MMORPDND Main GUI}
	\label{fig:mmorpdnd_gui}
\end{figure}

The GUI window is somewhat self explanatory. The two main features are represented by red buttons - the `test` and `update` features. There are also other buttons to simple perform and of the individual tasks using the appropriately associated button.

\subsubsection{Command Line}

The MMORPDND application supports some command line features.

\begin{lstlisting}
usage: mmorpdnd.py [-h] [-t] [-u]

optional arguments:
	-h, --help    show this help message and exit
	-t, --test    Runs the test-all feature then exit.
	-u, --update  Runs the update-all feature then exit.

Example:
	Assuming from_file = '/path/to/source/file.html' and to_file = '/path/to/target/image.jpg',
	the method will return '../../target/image.jpg' as the relative path.

Note: 
	The method uses the `os.path.relpath()` function to calculate the relative path.

Example usage:

\section{templates/creator.py}



\subsection{Purpose}

The creator tool is a practical solution for converting basic template text files into functional HTML pages. It takes care of the technical aspects by automatically creating HTML files and filling in missing details, like character stats or other content. The tool understands the structure of your template files, recognizes placeholders, and replaces them with accurate data. Whether you're building character profiles, story summaries, or any content with consistent formatting, this tool ensures your HTML documents are correctly formatted and ready for use. It simplifies the process, letting you focus on content creation while it handles the conversion from templates to HTML.

\subsection{Use}

The creator tool is a powerful tool that contains many subtle features. It is important to understand these subtleties before using the tool and therefore I encourage the reader to read this enture section before use. 

\subsubsection{GUI}

\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{The MMORPDND Main GUI}
	\label{fig:creator_gui}
\end{figure}

SECTION IN PROGRESS!

\subsubsection{Input Files (.input)}

The input files are essentially just text files with the file extension `.input'. The main feature of the creator.py tool is to read in these input files, parse them, and generate the appropriate html files from them. These input files must follow a strict formatting but offer a few various helpful features. Each line of the input file represents a 'section' of the html file that will be generated. Each line follows the following format:
\begin{lstlisting}
Heading Text[type]=Information text
\end{lstlisting}
The "Heading Text" is what will appear as the header for that html section. The "type" value is what determines the properties of this section and how it is interpreted by the creator tool. The "Information text" is the actual information for that section. The only exception to this rule is the first line which defines the "folder" that the html file generated from the input file will be placed into. This "folder" line is special in that it has no type and the creator tool will recognize the folder keyword and store this information separately. This folder line must be formatted as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
folder=path/to/where/I/want/my/generated/file
\end{lstlisting}
The various types determine the formatting and decoding of the input file, and each type has small subtleties. The various types are
\begin{enumerate}
	\item dnd-image: This type is used to display an image or multiple images.
 	\item dnd-list: This is used to display a list of items.
 	\item dnd-info: This is used for general information and sections. It also supports listing information between paragraphs.
  	\item dnd-music: This is a section for storing various music for the regions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Example Input File}

For example input files, you can look inside the templates/trash folder. This is where input files get placed after they are finished processing. The following is an example input file with an example of many different elements. The associated image files `foobar.jpg', `foobars (1).jpg' and `foobars (2).jpg' should be located in the templates/img folder for the below file to process correctly.

\begin{lstlisting}
folder=items

A Single Image[dnd-image]=img/foobar.jpg;Created by Someone;A foobar image.

Information Section[dnd-info]=Here is a paragraph of text.;Here is a second paragraph.

Information Section With Smaller Headers[dnd-info]=Here is a paragraph of text.;*Small Header* Here is a second paragraph.

A List Of Items[dnd-list]=item A; Item B; Item C; Item D

Multiple Images[dnd-image]=img/foobars.jpg;Created by Someone;Multiple foobar images.

Information Section with List[dnd-info]=Here is a paragraph of text followed by a list;-List_item_A;-List_item_B;-List_item_C;Followed by a paragraph.

Music And Ambiance[dnd-music]=https://youtube_link_1;https://youtube_link_2;https://youtube_link_3
\end{lstlisting}

The above file will create a file in the `items' folder found in `campaign/items'. The file will start with a header "A Single Image", where the foobar.jpg image is displayed. A caption of "A foobar image." will be under the image. Next will be a heading "Information Section" That has two paragraphs. Next a similar section with a header "Information Section With Smaller Headers", a paragraph, then a smaller header "Small Header", followed by another paragraph. Next, another heading "A List Of Items" with 4 items in the list. Following this, a "Multiple Images" heading with 2 images `foobars (1).jpg' and `foobars (2).jpg'\footnote{If an image is not found, it will automatically search for files with that image name with an appended (1), (2), (3),... If `(1)' is found, this image will be used and the number incrememted until no other images are found.} with a caption "Multiple foobar images." Next, another heading ``Information Section with List", with a paragraph, a list, and then another paragraph. Finally, a heading "Music And Ambiance" with links to three youtube videos. If the "download links" checkbox is enabled, these video's will be downloaded as mp3 files and the fodler icon will link to the local files.






\subsubsection{Character Files (.char)}

The character files are text files with the ".char" extension. These are a special type of input file that generates an html page specific for DnD character information. This was actually designed before the more general input file formatting outlined in the sections above and therefore lacks some of the versatility and extra features that can be included in the input files. Nevertheless, the character format creates an html page that should more than suffice for any npc characters and has many of its own unique features and capabilities. The .char file contains lines that define the various elements of a character. These lines to not currently support the types that are supported with the input files. Each line has a specific output format in the generated html file based on a template and the information itself. Some lines in the file are required while others are optional. The required lines must be present for the character file generated to be completed, while the optional lines will automatically be randomized and generated in the event that they are missing. Eahc line of the character file must be formatting in the following way:
\begin{lstlisting}
Keyword = Value
\end{lstlisting}
The "Keyword" is used by the creator tool to determine which type of information is being input, and the "Value" is the value of the information. For example "level = 3" would let the creator know that the character level is 3, and it will use that information appropriately.

Once the character file is appropriately filled out and created, it should be saved/placed in the templates/input\_files folder for processing by the creator tool just like the .input files. The creator tool will search the templates/img folder for any image references within the character files.






\subsubsection{Required Keywords}

The required keywords for a character file are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item folder: This defines the folder that the output html character file will be placed. This should be a valid file path to a folder.
	\item name: This defines the name of the character.
	\item image: This is an image for the character. This should be just the image file name and extension (no path) and the image itself should be placed in the "templates/img" folder for automatic detection.
	\item class: This defines the DnD class. This must be a valid class from the following list:
		\begin{multicols}{3}
		    \begin{itemize}
		        \item barbarian
		        \item bard
		        \item cleric
		        \item druid
		        \item fighter
		        \item monk
		        \item paladin
		        \item ranger
		        \item rogue
		        \item sorcerer
		        \item warlock
		        \item wizard
		    \end{itemize}
		\end{multicols}
	\item abilities: The abilities of the character. This field is a list and should be entered using a comma (`,') as the delimeter.
	\item equipment: The equipment of the character. This field is a list and should be entered using a comma (`,') as the delimeter.
	\item proficiencies: These are the proficiencies of the character. This field is a list and should be entered using a comma (`,') as the delimeter. The proficiency bonus will automatically be calculated based on level and applied to proficiencies.
	\item information: General information and description of the character.
\end{enumerate}

The above list of keywords are all required and if they are missing or ill-formatted, unexpected behavior can occur.






\subsubsection{Optional Keywords}

The optional keywords for a character file are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item level: This is the level of the character. If the level is not defined, it will default to 1. This must be an integer.
	\item hp: This will be generated automatically if not included based on the character class, level, and constitution\footnote{The constitution value is automatically generated based on the character class and level if not included.} value.
	\item ac: The Armor class value.
	\item size: The size of the character.
	\item type: The type of the character (creature, humanoid, animal, etc)
	\item alignment: The alignment of the character.
	\item speed: The speed of the character.
	\item resistances: The resistances the character has (if any).
	\item immunities: The immunities the character has (if any)
	\item senses: The senses. A ", Passive Perception: #" will automatically be appended to this value based on a calculated passive perception.
	\item languages: Languages of the character.
	\item race: The race of the character.
	\item background: The background of the character.
	\item strength: This represents the character's physical strength and ability to exert force. This must be an integer.
	\item dexterity: This represents the character's agility, reflexes, and fine motor skills. This must be an integer.
	\item constitution: This measures the character's health, stamina, and resistance to illness and fatigue. This must be an integer.
	\item intelligence: This reflects the character's mental acuity, memory, and problem-solving skills. This must be an integer.
	\item wisdom: This represents the character's perception, intuition, and common sense. This must be an integer.
	\item charisma: This measures the character's charm, persuasion, and ability to influence others. This must be an integer.
	\item notes: Notes to add about the character that aren't contained in the `information' section.
\end{enumerate}

It is recommended to include all values in the character file and just use "None" for any string values that are not needed. This will prevent any un-expected bugs. Many of the values replace a string in a template file based on the values input, so if they are not specified, a correlated `search string' will appear in the final html file that serves as a placeholder for the information.






\subsubsection{Example Character File}

For example character files, you can look inside the templates/trash/chars folder. This is where input files get placed after they are finished processing. The following is an example character file. The associated image file foobar.jpg should be located in the templates/img folder for the below file to process correctly.

\begin{lstlisting}
folder = characters/player
name = fooBar
ac = 16 (natural armor)
hp = 84
level = 13
size = small
type = humanoid
alignment = neutral good
speed = 30 ft.
resistances = None
immunities = None
senses = Darkvision 60ft
languages = Common, Elvish
image = foobar.jpg
race = Fooling
class = wizard
background = Barber
strength = 15
dexterity = 13
constitution = 18
intelligence = 22
wisdom = 4
charisma = 14
abilities = basic attack: A basic attack with nothing special; prestidigitation
equipment = torch; small sword, a potato
proficiencies = strength, acrobatics, history
information = This is some info for foobar, the template character.
notes = No notes needed for template dude.
\end{lstlisting}

Once created, the file should be placed in the templates/input\_files folder and then processed via the creator.py tool.

If it is a file, it calls the generate_char() or create_page() method based on the file extension.
If it is a directory, it iterates through each file within the directory and calls the generate_char()
or create_page() method for each individual file.

Returns:
    None

Raises:
    None

\begin{codebox}[Creator.generate\_char(self, file=global\_vars.current\_file)]
"""
Generate a character file based on the provided input file.

This method updates the input file, checks if it has the correct file type (.char),
generates character statistics and fields if they are not defined, replaces the fields
in the template file with the character information, and writes the new character file.

The process involves the following steps:
	1. Verifies if the input file has the correct file type (.char). If not, it displays an error message and exits.
	2. Retrieves the character fields from the input file.
	3. Determines the character class and level.
	4. If any fields are missing, generates default values for certain attributes and displays them.
	5. Calculates the character's hit points (hp) if not already defined.
	6. Generates the character file path and filename based on the character's name.
	7. Reads the character template file.
	8. Processes and replaces the fields in the template with the character information.
	   - Replaces general character fields.
	   - Calculates and inserts modifier values for certain attributes.
	   - Handles proficiencies and adds proficiency bonus to corresponding skills.
	   - Populates information, notes, and image blocks.
	   - Updates abilities and equipment lists.
	9. Writes the new character file at the specified filepath.
	10. If the option is selected, moves the input file to the trash.

\begin{codebox}[Creator.get\_user\_choice(self)]
"""
Displays a graphical user interface with yes/no buttons and returns the user's choice.

Args:
    None.

Returns:
    bool: The user's choice. True represents "yes" and False represents "no".

Raises:
    None.

This method displays a graphical user interface (GUI) with "yes" and "no" buttons and waits for the user to make a choice.
The GUI is implemented using a main event loop.

The method performs the following steps:
	1. Enables the "yes" and "no" buttons.
	2. Creates a BooleanVar to store the user's choice.
	3. Defines the callback functions that will be called when the buttons are clicked. These functions call the appropriate
	   methods (e.g., `self.yes()`, `self.no()`, `self.reset()`) and set the user_choice variable accordingly.
	4. Configures the buttons to call the respective callback functions.
	5. Starts the main event loop using `self.gui.mainloop()`.
	6. Disables the "yes" and "no" buttons after the user has made a choice.
	7. Returns the user's choice as a boolean value.

Note: The specific details of the GUI implementation, such as the actual buttons and their configuration, may depend on
the underlying GUI framework used.

Update the current input file and associated data.

This method updates the current input file based on the path entered in the GUI. If no file path
is provided, an appropriate message is displayed using the output_text method. If the provided
file path is different from the current file path, the global_vars object is reset, and the new
file path is set as the current file. Additionally, if the file's extension matches certain
predefined extensions (such as '.char', '.names', or '.list'), the lines from the file are read
and stored in the current_list attribute.

Example:
    gui_instance = MyGUI()
    gui_instance.path_text.set("data.txt")
    gui_instance.update_input_file()
    # The current input file is updated to 'data.txt', and associated data is adjusted.

This method generates a word using a probability matrix and prompts the user whether to append the generated word
to a file.

The method performs the following steps:
	1. Prints a message indicating that a word is being generated.
	2. Updates the input file.
	3. Generates a probability matrix based on the current list.
	4. Prints the generated probability matrix.
	5. Enters a loop that continues until the last user input is "reset".
	    a. Generates a word using the current probability matrix.
	    b. Outputs the generated word.
	    c. Asks the user if they want to append the word to the file.
	    d. Retrieves the user's choice.
	    e. If the user chooses "yes", the word is appended to the file.
	    f. If the user chooses "no", a message is outputted indicating that the word was not appended to the file.
	    g. If the user's choice is neither "yes" nor "no", the loop continues.
