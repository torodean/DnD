   <h3>
    Rightous Wielders
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    From righteous alignments springs forth extraordinary potential, empowering the Fang of Elaine with unparalleled prowess. Harness the Tapped Soul effect, allowing the blade to siphon frosty energies from adversaries, replenishing and rejuvenating the bearer in the heat of combat. Moreover, the ethereal touch of the Soul Frost Bite enchants each strike, enveloping the target's essence in a chilling frost. Once per turn, the inflicted foe endures additional frost damage, while subsequent attacks further constrict their movements, slowing them to a sluggish crawl.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Tapped Soul (Effect)
   </h4>
   <p class="subsection">
    On each strike of the weapon, you can choose to siphon 1d4 frost damage from the enemy and heal yourself.

   <h4>
    Improved Tapped Soul (Effect)
   </h4>
   <p class="subsection">
    The Tapped soul effect gains an extra 1d4 (Increasing to a total of 2d4).

    Soul Frost Bite
   </h4>
   <p class="subsection">
    When you make a melee attack with this weapon you can choose to inflict a Frosty chill to the soul of the target. This lasts for one hour or until dispelled. The target will take 1d4 extra frost damage once per turn on a melee attack against it with this weapon. If this effect is already on the target, you can choose to further chill the targets soul on a subsequent melee attack, which will decrease the targets movement by half next round.
