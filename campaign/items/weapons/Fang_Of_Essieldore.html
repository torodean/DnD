    Rightous Wielders
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    From righteous alignments springs forth extraordinary potential, empowering the Fang of Essieldore with unparalleled prowess. Harness the Tapped Soul effect, allowing the blade to siphon energies from adversaries, replenishing and rejuvenating the bearer in the heat of combat. Moreover, the ethereal touch of the poison Bite enchants each strike, enveloping the target's essence in a sinister poison. Once per turn, the inflicted foe endures additional poison damage, while subsequent attacks further weaken their movements, clouding their minds.

   <h4>
    Tapped Soul (Effect)
   </h4>
   <p class="subsection">
    On each strike of the weapon, you can choose to siphon 1d4 poison damage from the enemy and heal yourself.

   </h4>
   <p class="subsection">
    When you make a melee attack with this weapon you can choose to inflict a poison to the target. This lasts for one minute or until cured. The target will take 1d4 extra poison damage once per turn on a melee attack against it. If this effect is already on the target, you can choose to further poison the target on a subsequent melee attack, which will decrease the targets concentration next round by removing the ability to take any bonus actions.
