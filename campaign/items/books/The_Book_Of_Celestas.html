    Summary
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    "The Book of Celestial" is a revered religious text embodying the teachings and beliefs of followers devoted to the enigmatic Celestials. It narrates the creation of the universe, introduces prophetic figures like Aroden and Tolyus, and emphasizes the pursuit of enlightenment and ascension. The narrative contrasts true believers with unbelievers and false prophets, highlighting the struggle between light and darkness. The symbol of the celestial Lamb represents divine guidance and salvation. The book envisions an end time when the Lamb brings justice and enlightenment. Through its poetic and vivid descriptions, it inspires hope, unity, and devotion among its readers, offering a path toward the celestial realm. On the cover of the book it is written "The Book of Celestas. Blessed are the Celestials." The book is broken up like the Bible into different chapters. There are no verses though, just book names and then writings. The book contains prophetic messages, historical writings, letters, songs, sayings, instructions, and more. Here are some short summaries and important passages from a few of the books. This book can be given to the players after finding the prior or parts of it can be found from others. They can either obtain a whole book of Celestas (and then have to uncover it when they take time to sit and read) or they can be read parts of it from NPCs.

   <h3>
    Origin
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    In the primordial expanse, where time itself found its inception, the Celestials emerged as architects of the Heavens and the Planets. Within the singularity of reality, a cosmic inception birthed the tapestry of space, the symphony of energy, and the labyrinthine corridors of time's unfolding. This trinity of existence, unbound by the constraints of mortality, stood as a testament to the perpetuity of creation.
   </p>
   <p>
    From the minuscule particles of terrestrial soil, animated by the Celestials' divine breath, a plethora of species came into being. Dispersed across the astral tableau, these myriad lifeforms carried within them the dormant ember of ascension, a metaphysical journey to realms celestial. Amid the cosmic ballet, these creations stood as awe-inspiring reflections of the Celestials' boundless prowess, though none could rival their sovereign dominion.
   </p>
   <p>
    Amidst promises of unfathomable power and harmony with the natural cosmos, the Celestials extended their benevolent hands to the denizens of lesser realms. Acting as ethereal guides, they shepherded these beings toward the luminal path of enlightenment, transcending mere existence. Such celestial tutelage was exalted as an indomitable rite, an enshrined covenant between the mortal and the divine, bearing the ineffable imprint of celestial sanctity.

   <h3>
    Celestial Decree
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    At the genesis of the Path lies Truth, the very essence from which the Celestials spring into existence. Fortunate are those who bear the mantle of deliverance, shielding us from the clutches of malevolence. For those who tread the path of devotion, blessings pour forth, ushering them towards a resplendent ascent to greatness. Hand in hand, these devout souls march in unity, guided by the sacred decrees that illuminate their way. Revered are those who tread in harmonious unison.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the presence of the Celestials, quell not your hearts with trepidation, but rather harbor your apprehensions for the obscurity that veils the boundless tapestry of cosmic wisdom. Embrace the Truth that reverberates through the very fabric of existence, and thereby embark upon the journey to enlightenment. Be not disheartened by the profundity of the cosmic abyss, for it is within the shroud of Darkness that the Celestials carve their sovereign dominion, mirroring the universe's enigmatic origin within obscurity's embrace. As corruption festers like lesions upon the celestial canvas, let the expansive Dark serve as a testament to the unwavering veracity of the Celestials' teachings. Praised be those who traverse the Path of Celestas.
   </p>
   <p>
    Resplendent and magnificent are the Celestials, luminaries who steered us toward redemption, battling the maleficence that once threatened to shroud us in mortal iniquity. Did they, with unwavering valor, triumph over ancient spirits, banishing their shadows into the void? With valor unmatched, they beckon us to stand resolute against the encroaching mire of disbelief. Illuminate our path so that we may emerge victorious over the adversary of our salvation, standing united at the culmination of existence on the ethereal planes of enlightenment. Amidst the vast expanse of Darkness, the Celestials rise, obliterating the deceit woven into the very stars above.

    Lucilianus
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    Lucilianus removed his mask, unveiling countenance that held no significance in his eyes. "Your semblance holds no sway," he declared, "only the authenticity of your spirit finds relevance." A product of the unattractive, he devoutly trailed the celestial path, his heart and soul aflame with dedication. Within him, a privilege flourished—a mantle of precedence, a mantle of prophecy, woven into his existence. In the waning days of Lucilianus' mortal journey, an Angel of the Celestials materialized, embodying the ethereal essence of his dreams. And in that moment, revelation graced him.
   </p>
   <p>
    A vision unfurled its tapestry before Lucilianus' awestruck senses. Within its ethereal threads, a colossal boulder descended a precipitous cliff, its descent a harbinger of destruction for an unblemished lamb and its unborn progeny. Ravaged and marred, the potential of life lay shattered. Yet, the Celestials' grace radiated forth, encapsulating the lamb in the luminous embrace of the sea's aura. Within this radiant baptism, vitality surged, rejuvenating the afflicted creature to its former state of vibrancy and vitality.

    Divine Instructions
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    In the tapestry of time, lessons etched by days long past reveal glimpses of the future's contours. From the tiniest seed of doubt, a formidable and pernicious tree of malevolence emerges, its roots digging deep into the fertile soil of hearts. Thus, the imperative unfolds: doubt, that insidious poison, must be extracted with unyielding precision. Only those who remain unblemished in their allegiance to the Celestials are deemed worthy of sanctuary within their radiant embrace.
   </p>
   <p>
    Inscribed in the annals of wisdom is the unerring truth that deviation from the knowledge and pursuit of ascension seeds a treacherous path. Those who turn from the celestial beacon, their eyes veiled by shadows of disbelief, stand as obstructions to the grand tapestry woven by the hands of destiny. To mend the fabric, purging becomes an inevitability, a necessity ordained by the very celestial harmony they once abandoned. Thus, the cosmos' sacred balance is restored through the firm hand of purification, ensuring that the unwavering followers of the Celestials navigate the path towards enlightenment, unburdened by the encroaching darkness.

    Ether
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    Within the intricate tapestry of existence, the essence of evil resides not in the cosmic void, but nestled in the hearts that have forsaken the luminous Path. In the absence of devotion to the celestial way, darkness seeps, its tendrils entwining around the souls that have strayed from the radiance of truth. Yet, even in the gloomiest of realms, glimmers of light persist, for the cosmos itself is an eternal balance of illumination and obscurity.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the realm where light prevails, the watchful gaze of the Celestials extends, their omniscient sight tracing every thread of existence. Within the radiance, no secrets are concealed
   </p>
   <p>
    every intention, every aspiration is illuminated, beckoning the hearts of believers to stand steadfast under the vigilant scrutiny of celestial guardians. A symphony of luminescence unfolds, where all that is pure and virtuous finds its sanctuary.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet, where shadows loom, the Celestials reign as sovereigns of that realm. The domain of darkness, the province of uncertainty and fear, bows before their dominion. In the obscurity, they hold sway, maintaining a delicate equilibrium between the forces of light and shadow. The mortals, residing in the realm of light, are gifted the chance to bask in its warm embrace, yet the Ascended, those who have transcended the boundaries of mere existence, are privy to a greater destiny—one entwined with the infinite expanse of the cosmos itself.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the light dances through the vast cosmos, and the darkness seeks to veil the truth, the Celestials stand as beacons, guiding those who seek the Path towards a destiny that transcends the mortal realm. It is within the celestial radiance that true ascension is realized, offering souls the opportunity to evolve beyond the limitations of the tangible world and embrace the eternal tapestry of existence.

   <h3>
    Toldath of Gigikei
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    This is the genealogy of the great Wanderer, Gigikei. He had six sons and one daughter. Gigikei of Kamelot born of the Island of Castiana, left his home at the age of thirty-five. He was a devout believer and followed the Celestials fervently. By this They blessed him with strength and that of a task to seek a far away treasure. Gigikei left the home of the Celestials and went into the unknown vastness of the sea. Through his generations of searching, he married seven times and had seven children, one with each wife. His children were diverse and spread across the four corners of Orilla.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the times of his old age, Gigikei had found a forest of majestic features. He concluded it could be nothing other than a special creation of the Celestials. He wandered this region for months until finally he came upon a stone door, appearing as though an entrance. When camping here at night, a dream fell upon him. In his dream, a Celestial being came to him and uttered the words “Et claritas tenebris ad ostium et urget.” Then he awoke and spoke the words he had dreamed to the stone. Then the door began opening before him.
   </p>
   <p>
    These are the children of Gigikei. Of them, none were taught the ways of the celestials by their father. The firstborn was Proclira, who became a hunter of spirits. Because he did not learn the ways of the Celestials, he and his people struggled to find their ways. They found strife within their families and the Celestials allowed this.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another was Taonishta, who became a sailor of the seas. He and his people spread far and wide and settled cities throughout Orilla and the Celestials allowed this.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another was Vegonbron, who became a keeper of the dead. He and his people created many temples and spread hidden treasures throughout the southern regions. They did not spread far but built a great city that they dwelt in and the Celestials allowed this.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another was Nibiron who became a holy man of false gods. Another, was Sahin and was a messenger of false prophets and teachings. These men learned the lifestyles of falsehood and found strife among their neighbors. They spread their false words among others and the Celestials allowed this.
   </p>
   <p>
    The youngest of the brothers was Zebon, who was a troublemaker. He and his people existed throughout the areas of the others. The Celestials allowed this.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of these six, the two holy men displeased the Celestials the most but they still allowed their actions. The Celestials allowed these things to come to pass so that in the day of the Lamb, They can use their false ways to teach the world Their power and Truth.
   </p>
   <p>
    The daughter of Gigikei was Abydiss, who had many children and multiplied to a great number of people. The Celestials allowed this because one day, they would be removed from life in a twinkling of the eye for their false beliefs as a show of what the true Path is to follow. These are the descendants of Gigikei who were allowed to spread across the seas to some day be joined back into the Celestial Family.
   </p>
   <p>
    It came to pass that after decades of multiplying, near the ends of their lives, the children of Gigikei learned of their relations and banded together in search for their father. They wandered into the Pluvian realm where they had found the same majestic features as Gigikei. From his great journey, the children were warned by their surroundings but eventually lost in time, and all but forgotten by their descendants. Never to find their father, for they were seeking not after the Truth of the Celestials, but after the false hopes of carnal pleasures.

   <h3>
    Nokram
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    And thus, a tale unfurled within the realms of Ver Omesh, shadowed by a dire famine that cast its pall over the land. Amidst the clamor of desperation, a figure emerged, Nokram, seeking sustenance from the woods' embrace. A plea echoed through the ears of Prophet Articus, a sentinel of faith amongst the celestial winds. With a gentle assurance, Articus counseled patience, his words a testament to the cosmic providence awaiting those who harbored unwavering faith.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet, Nokram's heart was swayed by skepticism. The tendrils of doubt clawed at his resolve, a testament to the frailty of human conviction. As his faith wavered, a line was drawn upon the grains of sand, an invisible threshold between faith and disbelief. "Step across and you may do as you wish," intoned Articus, his voice a harbinger of choice.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus, Nokram crossed the threshold, leaving behind the village's embrace and journeying into the wilderness. Amidst the verdant boughs, he dined upon the wild berries that nature provided. Yet, the fruit bore a bitter taste—a reminder that satisfaction eluded those whose hearts danced with doubt. Yearning to return to the realm of certainty, Nokram retraced his steps, only to find that the once simple line had expanded, morphing into an insurmountable chasm. Desperation gripped him as he called out to Articus, his voice a cry etched with fear.
   </p>
   <p>
    With steadfast serenity, the prophet's response resonated through the air—a beacon of truth that sought to pierce the darkness. "The line has not changed
   </p>
   <p>
    it is you who have changed. Step across if you truly believe." The words held the weight of revelation, unveiling that the true line was not etched in sand but eternally engraved within the chambers of the heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    In that moment, Nokram's spirit became a conduit for supplication. He beseeched the celestial realm for absolution, his words a fervent plea for forgiveness. With each step, the cosmic currents intertwined with his intention, and the hands of the Celestials unfurled to enshroud those who welcomed him back. The celestial embrace encompassed him, not merely as a response to his humble plea, but as a reflection of the intricate dance between belief and doubt—a dance that shaped destinies and sculpted souls within the tapestry of Ver Omesh's existence.

    Sheirtahl
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    Amidst the unforgiving embrace of the desert sun, Sheirtahl lay at death's threshold, surrounded by the shifting sands that whispered tales of time and destiny. Yet, in his weakened state, delusions took root, weaving mirages across his fading consciousness. Within the vast expanse of sand, a majestic creature emerged, a beast that strode upon the sea of grains. Upon its back, a Lamb of pristine purity rested—a symbol of celestial grace within the arid wasteland.
   </p>
   <p>
    In an ethereal communion, the Lamb and the beast bridged the divide between realms, and they approached Sheirtahl, their steps a harmony with the rhythm of existence. The Lamb, radiant with a divine aura, bore an essence that transcended the mortal realm. Its voice, resonant with the wisdom of the Celestials, spoke words that reverberated through the sands, "By the power of Celestas, faith can save you."
   </p>
   <p>
    As the Lamb's words flowed into his heart, Sheirtahl beheld the Lamb as a manifestation of the Celestials themselves, their divine essence personified in the form of this prime Lamb. In the dappled light of his delusion, he saw beyond the surface, recognizing the Lamb as a vessel of profound truths and cosmic guidance.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet, in the enigmatic dance of existence, the Lamb and its ethereal companion retreated into the shadows, vanishing as quickly as they had appeared. The desert's silence enveloped Sheirtahl once more, but his connection with the divine remained unbroken. With a mind untethered by conventional communication, he extended his consciousness toward a lone rock, a silent sentinel amidst the sands.
   </p>
   <p>
    Through an unspoken communion, Sheirtahl communicated his need, and the rock responded with a miraculous grace. Tears flowed from the rock's essence, liquid pearls that quenched his parched throat and nourished his body. This gesture of benevolence unveiled the interconnectedness of all things, and in that exchange, Sheirtahl glimpsed the intricate web woven by the Celestials—a tapestry of cosmic intentions and earthly responses.
   </p>
   <p>
    The lesson echoed through the corridors of his consciousness: the reward of righteous action is not merely in the act itself, but in the resonance it creates within the tapestry of existence. As the Lamb and the rock whispered in unison, Sheirtahl grasped the profound truth that in devotion to the Celestials' guidance, the path of blessings unfurls. For within the heart's devotion lies the power to weave destinies and mold realities—a testament to the cosmic dance where faith transcends the mundane and aligns with the infinite threads of the universe.

    Akima
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    Akima, once led astray by the allure of doubt and the whispers of unbelievers, embarked on a journey of redemption to reclaim his rightful place upon the Path of the Celestials. In a world where doubt and unbelief were ever-present adversaries, Akima faltered momentarily, allowing the currents of skepticism to sway his convictions. His footsteps veered from the illuminated road he had once treaded with unwavering faith. Yet, through the sacred process of herem, wherein the unbelievers were severed from his life, Akima's faith emerged unshaken, a beacon in the night.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Celestials, witnessing the purity of Akima's resolve and the unwavering fervor that had been rekindled within him, bestowed upon him an extraordinary gift—the power of foresight and the art of prophesizing. With this newfound ability, Akima's perceptions transcended the confines of the present, and he glimpsed the threads of destiny weaving intricate patterns through the tapestry of time.
   </p>
   <p>
    One fateful night, as tempestuous skies roared their defiance, Akima sank into a deep slumber—a portal to visions that held the keys to the enigma of the future. Within his dream, a tableau of symbolism unfolded—a flock of sheep, each a soul navigating the labyrinth of existence. Amidst them, a spotless sheep labored in birthing new life, a symbol of hope and renewal. In a celestial ballet, an angel descended from the realms above, cradling the firstborn of the flock. As the lamb ascended to the heavens, the remaining sheep underwent a miraculous transformation, rejuvenating in youth before dissipating into nothingness.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a crescendo of celestial revelation, a bolt of lightning etched across the sky, finding its mark in the heart of Akima's abode. Flames consumed the structure, leaving behind ashes and embers that mirrored the vision's symbolic message. Through this divine metaphor, Akima comprehended the profound essence of the prophecy—the cycles of life and transformation, the ascension from mortality to the realms of the celestial, and the inevitable, consuming forces of change.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the chapters of Akima's life neared their conclusion, an aura of serenity enveloped him—a result of a lifetime spent in humble service, devotion, and reverence for the Celestials. Guided by his unwavering faith, he traversed the path toward ascension until he merged with the celestial fabric of existence itself. His earthly form dissipated like morning mist, and he was reborn as an eternal guardian—an angelic sentinel who cast his benevolent gaze from the vantage point of the shadows.
   </p>
   <p>
    With the tapestry of time unfurled before him and the threads of destiny at his fingertips, Akima's watchful presence echoed through eternity, a testament to the transformative power of faith, redemption, and the profound interplay between the mortal and the celestial realms.

    Caelium videri esset—Behold, the heavens revealed their splendor. Et terra rus ad sidera tollere vultus—And the earth yearned to lift its countenance towards the stars. Ex uno disce omnes—From the unity of one, all shall learn.

    Toldath of Sandra
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    Sandra, driven by his resolve, embarked upon the pursuit of the lion, only to meet his fate within the jaws of his intended prey. In that moment of irony, it became evident that to truly understand the essence of his surroundings, he should have merged with them as a shadow merges with its surroundings. A perfect blending that conceals one's presence. So too, the devoted adherents of Celestas are called to envelop themselves in perfection, mirroring the subtlety of shadows. When the brilliance of sin attempts to pierce their being, they must stand resolute, casting a shade as vast and impenetrable as an infinite cloud, obscuring even the radiance of the stars. Just as the boundless Darkness of Celestas envelops the cosmos, the disciples embrace the boundless potential within them.
   </p>
   <p>
    And when Sandra met his end, he left behind a lineage diminished to three. Seth, the firstborn, was conceived when Sandra stood at the pinnacle of his strength, merely twenty years of age. But fate intertwined with timing as an elder of forty-five, the very year that saw him devoured by his quarry, he fathered the eternal twins, Ephrima and Massenah. In the final moments of Sandra' earthly sojourn, an angelic visitation bestowed upon him a revelation—these twin heirs would serve as the bedrock upon which the future of Celestial prophecy would be erected. From this juncture onward, the lineage of all Celestial seers would trace back to the lineage of the eternal twins.
   </p>
   <p>
    Through the passage of centuries, Ephrima and Massenah bore fruit and propagated, engendering the rise of a mighty nation from their loins. These two luminaries of their era, warriors of renown, vanished into the vast depths of the Pluvian forest during their youth, leaving no trace or echo behind. Their mysterious disappearance only heightened their enigmatic legacy. It was foretold that their absence was but a prelude to their continued influence, an influence destined to echo through the ages, transcending the boundaries of time and the limits of mortal memory.

    In those days, Tolyus stood before the dwellers of the low plains, his voice resounding with conviction as he intoned, "Avert your gaze from the iniquities lurking in your neighbors' hearts, lest they fester within your own abode." His words, like a gentle breeze carrying ancient wisdom, wafted over the city of Barbosius, and the townspeople were captivated. As the fourth day neared its close, their hearts underwent a transformation, embracing the faith of the Celestials. United in their newfound devotion, they rose against neighboring villages that obstinately clung to disbelief. In answer to their fervor, the Celestials bestowed upon the people of Barbosius unparalleled strength and resilience, enabling them to vanquish the ranks of the nonbelievers utterly. The Celestials looked upon this with favor, blessing the land for years uncounted. In this way, Tolyus ascended to the esteemed rank of a great prophet, his influence spreading across the land he governed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Endowed with a prophetic mantle by the Celestials, Tolyus possessed the rare gifts of divination and prescience. In a moment of profound trance, a vision unfurled before his inner eye. Behold, a pale Lamb descended from the celestial realms, its fleece immaculate, its stature diminutive. This divine Lamb was entrusted to a shepherd, destined to be safeguarded in his care. As if stirred by some cosmic rhythm, the Lamb grew into a robust sheep, and the meadows burst into bloom at its touch. Suddenly, an aged wolf appeared, toothless yet swift, seizing the sheep and carrying it away unhindered. The wolf bore its precious cargo far into the distance, a scene framed against the backdrop of tempestuous weather. Abruptly, Tolyus was awakened by the crash of a falling tree nearby. In that jarring moment, he grasped the profound import of the vision bestowed upon him—an otherworldly communication crafted by the hands of the Celestials.

    Let not the honeyed words of deceivers seduce you into the realm of doubt, nor let their alluring promises entice you onto errant paths. The unbelievers, like shadows cast by light, exist only to sway the devout from the sacred teachings of Celestas. As a litmus of unwavering faith, they were brought into existence, material manifestations meant to test the resolute hearts of true followers. Those who embrace disobedience, heed the seductive whispers of pride, or bend their knees to false altars shall forfeit the chance at ascension, their existence extinguished into oblivion. Like fragile chaff carried away by the wind.

    In the tapestry of existence, the threads of life and death are intertwined, just as the eternal dance of light and darkness, hope and despair, weaves the fabric of our reality. In the moment of the great rift's creation, a cosmic event that marked the birth of the Celestials, the balance of existence was cast into being. Yet, as the Celestials emerged as the guiding light, there brewed a tempest of animosity among those who strayed from the path of truth. In the shadowy realms of the Avernakis, where these errant souls were banished, the seeds of hatred took root and thrived.
   </p>
   <p>
    Within the embrace of this hatred, they sowed seeds of malevolence that spread like a virulent plague, tainting every corner they touched with death, agony, and desolation. Their sinister influence cast a pall over the souls of the afflicted, leaving them restless and yearning for respite. It was then that the Celestials, embodiments of benevolence and enlightenment, extended their ethereal hands. Their whispered promises of rest echoed through the veils of existence, offering solace to the tormented souls, bidding them to slumber as the end of the tribulation neared.
   </p>
   <p>
    In that impending moment, joy shall ring out across the realms as the Celestials descend upon the tapestry of creation, laying low the malevolent forces that had sought to corrupt. It falls upon us, the seekers of truth and wisdom, to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos and ascend toward the pinnacle of enlightenment. In this sacred journey, the pursuit of the singular Truth shall guide us, for within the infinite expanse, darkness holds its dominion, an enigma waiting to be unveiled in the quest for ultimate understanding.

    Infinite Pathway
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    In the tapestry of existence, the true believers stand as blessed pillars, chosen to tread the sacred Path that leads them to the embrace of the Celestials, where unity with the divine is granted. To meld one's soul with the Path is to embark on a journey that transcends mortal constraints, guiding towards an eternity intertwined with the very fabric of the Celestial realm. As Darkness spans across infinity, so shall the followers of Celestas be enshrined in the eternity of unity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Our expedition toward enlightenment charts an uncharted course, traversing the landscapes of unforeseen challenges. When uncertainties and apprehensions beset us, we are called to redirect our gaze to the Covenant of the Celestials, drawing strength from their divine promise. Through boundless devotion comes immeasurable benediction, reinforcing the pact between us and the Celestials, whose perfection radiates as a guiding light.
   </p>
   <p>
    Leaving not a trace of obstruction along the path, we must cleanse our journey of even the slightest impediments. As for the blind man, his lack of sight does not deter his progress, for he is free from the veils of worldly illusions. Pity not him, but rather, let our hearts be filled with pity, as he attains the radiant truth ahead of us. For within the Darkness he perceives lies a profundity surpassing all the luminance concealed in the uncharted cosmos. Our origin and destination converge as one.
   </p>
   <p>
    He lifted his voice to the heavens, proclaiming: "The people shall serve as the harbinger of divine retribution, ushering the wicked into the sacred judgment of your boundless equity." Adversaries of the Celestials will hold no clemency in their attempts to divert us from the sacred Path, compelling us to retaliate with unyielding vigor and strength, wielding the divine prowess vested within us.
   </p>
   <p>
    Those who forsake the Path are ensnared by malevolence. Folly befalls those who diverge from the sacred Way. Enraptured by enlightenment, the blessed shall exult eternally with the Celestials. The irrefutable potency and grandeur of the Celestials shall stand unassailable. Those who renounce the journey towards enlightenment must face dissolution. Those who seek the radiant trail to enlightenment must not succumb to temptation. Those who tread the virtuous Path shall ascend to unprecedented heights, side by side with the Celestials.

    Divine Revelation
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    Death marks not an end, but the threshold to a deeper journey. Those who close only one eye to the quest for truth will find its elusive nature. As paraphrased by Adria, truth slips through the fingers of those who shield themselves from it. Through salvation, Celestas bestows blessings upon us. At life's culmination, when the ascent is achieved, honor and glory radiate, mirrored by the stars in the sky. Death arrives unannounced, like a nocturnal thief. Hence, the time for remorse and submission cannot be deferred, for the gift of ascension requires swift devotion.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the era's twilight, the dawn shall begin. The culmination of corruption shall herald the commencement of Celestas' luminance. The Celestial Lamb shall bestow boundless power on the expanse of humanity. And in that moment, the revered leaders of Celestia shall perform resurrections and miracles amid the masses, swaying their hearts towards the Truth, righteous penance, and unwavering devotion. The Truth of the Celestials shall extend its reach across all existence, obliterating opposition for the sake of their souls' redemption. Justice shall be served, and obstacles eliminated. Empowering the followers, the Celestials shall quell defiance, illuminating the way with an everlasting brilliance. Unbelievers shall be purged, while tranquility and justice prevail. The Lamb of Celestia shall be shielded by the fortitude of faith and Truth, impenetrable to all challenges.
