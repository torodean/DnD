Its dry prose and excessive diagrams make it a niche item, worth 7 gp to a naturalist.
</p></div><hr><div class="dnd-info"><h3>Summary</h3><p class="first-paragraph">The book catalogs toad species, their habitats, and mating calls with exhaustive precision. A lengthy chapter debates whether toads possess emotions, concluding they are "stoic but misunderstood." "Practical uses" include a dubious recipe for toad-skin boots and a warning against licking them.
