Its faded ink and odd ingredients make it a curiosity worth 10 gp to a chef or historian.
</p></div><hr><div class="dnd-info"><h3>Summary</h3><p class="first-paragraph">The book lists meals like "stewed eel with honey glaze" and "roasted cave beetle pie," with detailed instructions.Many ingredients, such as "duskoroot" or "glimmerfish," are extinct or unknown, rendering most recipes impractical. A few legible pages offer tips on preserving meat that could still be useful to an adventurous cook.
