Its meticulous records hint at shady dealings, valued at 15 gp by those who study underworld history.

Prices are listed in both gold and cryptic terms like "three nightsâ€™ silence" or "a favor unasked," suggesting unusual trades. The final page notes a massive debt left unpaid, with a bloodstain smudging the last entry.
