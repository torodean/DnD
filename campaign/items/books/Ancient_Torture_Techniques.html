   <h3>
    Torture In Simplicity
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    Many years ago there was a grand wizard Eliv Prophena who was a master of finding masterful solutions to problems using extremely simplistic ideas. With respect to the concept of torture, he invented 13 rings which enhanced the bodies own sensations as teh perfect form of torture. These rings are perfectly unique and have never been successfully duplicated (as far as the author of this book is aware). Posession of one of these rings would bring great wealth to the bearer. Each ring enhances a specific sensation which increases over time, while acting as a double edged sword.

   </p>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    In the annals of history, there have been accounts of individuals who attempted to master the Rings of Eliv Prophena. These trials were harrowing, with each bearer experiencing the height of their respective torment. Notable among these accounts is the tale of Sir Belwin, a knight who sought to prove his endurance by wearing the Ring of Obsidian Itch. He lasted a mere three days before succumbing to the overwhelming urge to begin biting at his own skin with his teeth. His story serves as a stark reminder of the insidious nature of these rings.

   <h3>
    Psychological Terrors
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    Physical pain is not the only method of torture
   </p>
   <p>
    psychological torment can be equally, if not more, effective. Techniques designed to break the mind and spirit were employed by some of the most sinister minds in history.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Mock Executions
   </h4>
   <p class="subsection">
    The victim is led to believe they are about to be executed, only for the execution to be halted at the last moment. This process is repeated to instill constant fear and anxiety.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Water Torture
   </h4>
   <p class="subsection">
    Also known as Chinese water torture, a steady drip of water onto the victim's forehead drives them to madness over time.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Sleep Deprivation
   </h4>
   <p class="subsection">
    Preventing the victim from sleeping, causing severe cognitive impairment, hallucinations, and eventual psychological collapse.
   </p>
   <h4>
    Sensory Deprivation
   </h4>
   <p class="subsection">
    Placing the victim in an environment where they cannot see, hear, or feel anything, leading to disorientation and mental breakdown.
   </p>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    These devices and techniques are a testament to the dark ingenuity of torturers throughout history, each designed to break the will and spirit of their victims in the most excruciating ways possible.
