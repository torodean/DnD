The pages are stained and brittle, worth 5 gp to a collector of oddities.
</p></div><hr><div class="dnd-info"><h3>Summary</h3><p class="first-paragraph">The journal begins with optimistic notes about a journey into a dense, unnamed forest, complete with sketches of strange plants. As pages progress, the tone shifts to paranoia, describing unseen watchers and eerie noises. The final entries are incoherent ramblings about a "shining cave" that the author never found, ending mid-sentence.
