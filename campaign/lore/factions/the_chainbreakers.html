    Overview
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    The Chainbreakers are a defiant gang of prisoners scattered across
    <a href="../../locations/regions/Matella/Daystone_Isle/havenholme/Havenholme.html">
     Havenholme
    </a>
    ’s labor camps, united by a burning hatred for the Daystone royal family and a desperate dream of escape. Formed in the shadows of the island’s mines and fields, they’re a mix of hardened criminals and wronged souls who see their confinement as a temporary setback rather than a life sentence. Their name is a whispered rallying cry among the oppressed, though their bold talk of freedom is tempered by the reality of
    <a href="../../locations/regions/Matella/Daystone_Isle/havenholme/Havenholme.html">

    ’s cliffs and watchful guards. They clash often with

   </p>
   <p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      They smuggle tools and shivs between camps, trading stolen mining picks for fish or cloth.
     </li>
     <li>
      They sabotage mining quotas in the Red Camp to disrupt the Daystone’s profits, hoping to spark chaos.
     </li>
     <li>
      They bribe Blue Camp laborers with hoarded rations to carry messages or look the other way.
     </li>
     <li>
      They scout the northern cliffs for weak points, despite the Watch Commanders’ scrying eyes.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
    Their biggest move was a failed breakout from the Orange Camp, thwarted when

    tipped off the Insurrectionists, earning them a blood feud that still simmers.
