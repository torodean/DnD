    Overview
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    The Tidewraith Crew is a small, elusive gang of smugglers and cutthroats that haunts the ports and back alleys of
    <a href="../../locations/cities/Vifavea/Vifavea.html">
     Vifavea
    </a>
    . Born from the salty winds and restless tides of the Mozedd Peninsula, they exploit the town’s dual sea ports and thriving trade to line their pockets with ill-gotten coin. The crew is a ragtag band of locals and drifters, united by a shared disdain for authority and a knack for slipping through the cracks of
    <a href="../../locations/cities/Vifavea/Vifavea.html">

    </a>
    ’s bustling districts. Their name comes from whispered tales of their ghostly evasiveness—sailors claim they vanish into the sea breeze like wraiths when the law draws near.

      Jorak Tideclaw: A burly human fisherman turned enforcer, known for his brutal fists and a net-like scar across his face.
     </li>
     <li>
      Mila Seawisp: A sly halfling pickpocket who works the Mercatrade District, her small size perfect for dodging through market crowds.
     </li>
     <li>
      Tevrin Dusksail: A quiet elven navigator who maps smuggling routes, his knowledge of the Eldaran coast unmatched.

   <h3>
    Base of Operations
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    The Tidewraith Crew operates from a concealed camp along the flat, sandy shores just south of the Sea Breeze District, where the
    <a href="../../items/plants/Bastheti_Palm.html">
     Bastheti Palm
    </a>
    sway over sun-bleached dunes. Their hideout is a cluster of weathered yurts and tarp-covered caches, tucked behind a natural rise in the sand that shields it from casual view. Accessible by foot across the beach or by shallow-draft skiffs through the surf, it’s close enough to the southern port for quick hauls but far enough to dodge the harbormasters’ patrols. The camp smells of brine and smoked fish, with stolen goods stashed beneath palm fronds and guarded by the crew’s wary eyes.

    Their boldest move was hijacking a shipment of Lumiberries bound for the Silverleaf Apothecary, a haul they sold to a shadowy alchemist in a neighboring town, though it earned them the wrath of
