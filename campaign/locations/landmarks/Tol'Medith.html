At the heart of the structure lies the main chamber, featuring a grand central pillar surrounded by four chambers—dedicated to honor, nature, dragons, and the undead—on each side.

Above the library, smaller chambers house laboratories, living quarters, and various other functional spaces. Adorned with relics, statues, artifacts, intricately carved maps, and stunning architecture, the main chamber exudes an aura of reverence and awe. The ambience is dimly lit, with concealed lights scattered throughout the structure, waiting to be activated by those who possess the knowledge to do so.
