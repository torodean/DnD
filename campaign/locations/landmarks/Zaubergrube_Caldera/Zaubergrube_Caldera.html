    Zaubergrube Caldera
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    The Zaubergrube Caldera, located in Visterguard, appears as a large naturally occuring crator or sink hole type formation. A very powerful and magical illusion spell of unknown origin has covered this crater for thousands of years. The illusory cover begins a great distance down into the crator below much of the naturally forming landscape. The illusive spell creates an appearance of a deep hole that traverses endlessly into the core of the planet - detering any from entering. Beneath the illusory cover, lies a densly forested jungle containing many beasts and creatures. This jungle area is much larger than the natural crater appears.
