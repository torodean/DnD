    E.N.G.A.G.E. System
   </h3>
   <p class="first-paragraph">
    The Earning New Gains through Active Growth Endeavors (E.N.G.A.G.E.) System is designed to infuse character progression with dynamic and active elements, allowing players to shape their characters through earned gains achieved via active growth endeavors that the characters live during game downtime. In this system, characters accumulate 'Gains' through successful sessions, missions, creative role-playing, and personal accomplishments. At the end of each session, players are rewarded with Gains, reflective of their active engagement and achievements. These points can be strategically allocated across various categories, such as leveling up, acquiring new skills, enhancing attributes, or unlocking special abilities.
   </p>
   <p>
    The core philosophy of the system is the name of the system "Earning New Gains through Active Growth Endeavors," emphasizing that character development is not solely a passive process but a reflection of the character's active engagement and contributions to the unfolding narrative. Whether through mastering new skills, leveling up, or unlocking unique abilities, players have the agency to actively shape the trajectory of their characters' growth. Additionally, the E.N.G.A.G.E. System encourages players to participate actively in downtime activities, training, and quests, creating a synergistic relationship between in-game actions and character advancement. This dynamic approach ensures that characters evolve organically, reflecting the choices, actions, and endeavors of the players as they navigate the rich and immersive world of the campaign.
