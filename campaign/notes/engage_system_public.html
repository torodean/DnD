<h3>
    E.N.G.A.G.E. System
   </h3>
<p class="first-paragraph">
    The Earning New Gains through Active Growth Endeavors (E.N.G.A.G.E.) System is designed to infuse character progression with dynamic and active elements, allowing players to shape their characters through earned gains achieved via active growth endeavors that the characters live during game downtime. In this system, characters accumulate 'Gains' through successful sessions, missions, creative role-playing, and personal accomplishments. At the end of each session, players are rewarded with Gains, reflective of their active engagement and achievements. These points can be strategically allocated across various categories, such as leveling up, acquiring new skills, enhancing attributes, or unlocking special abilities.
   </p>
<p>
    The core philosophy of the system is the name of the system "Earning New Gains through Active Growth Endeavors," emphasizing that character development is not solely a passive process but a reflection of the character's active engagement and contributions to the unfolding narrative. Whether through mastering new skills, leveling up, or unlocking unique abilities, players have the agency to actively shape the trajectory of their characters' growth. Additionally, the E.N.G.A.G.E. System encourages players to participate actively in downtime activities, training, and quests, creating a synergistic relationship between in-game actions and character advancement. This dynamic approach ensures that characters evolve organically, reflecting the choices, actions, and endeavors of the players as they navigate the rich and immersive world of the campaign.

    Earning New Gains
   </h3>
<p class="first-paragraph">
    Gains come in the form of points that can be spent on Active Growth Endeavors (see below section). At the end of each session, the DM will decide how many Gains the players receive for that session. These points accumulate over time and can be spent at any point during game downtime. They cannot be spent during gameplay as they represent activities which your character would be spending time to improve upon. You do not have to spend all your Gains and they can be stored or saved for later use.

    These are all the endeavors that your character can be working on during game downtime. If they choose, they can spend their time learning a new language, studying, learning new skills, or more. Different tasks take varying amounts of work. The "Spending Gains" Chart below shows how many points it takes for each form of growth.
