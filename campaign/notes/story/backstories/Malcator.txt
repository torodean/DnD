Heir to a clan of mountain dwarves, Malcator dreamt about leading his family’s clan one day. He knew that it was his familial duty to lead his clan in the future. That became more clear when he started to develop a gift for the magic arts: a gift that rarely develops in this particular clan of mountain dwarves. Not only did he develop a strong gift in magic, he had a special knack at divination. The dreams he had been having were glimpses of the future. What he had thought was luck was actually small visions that he was able to interpret. Inspired by the potential to see the future, he went to a prestigious school for magic, Hagwilt's School for the Magically Gifted. There, he honed his ability to see the future and continued to dream about leading his clan. As Malcator strengthened his magical abilities, his vision became stronger and clearer until one day he saw something he wished he hadn’t seen.

During one of his dreams of the future, Malcator saw himself leading his clan to short term success but that would ultimately lead to the destruction of his clan. Scared by this vision, Malcator resolved to do whatever it took to avert this future. However in all of his readings and studies, Malcator has failed to learn if his future could be averted. He also could not see what actions he would take that would lead to the disastrous future. All he knew was that the first step to that dark reality would be him leading his clan. 

Hoping to never become the leader of his clan and still haunted by his recurring dreams, Malcator resolves to travel the world looking for a way to change his future and avoid any reason to return to his clan. He has not had any contact with his clan ever since going on the run fearing what he would do to them.
