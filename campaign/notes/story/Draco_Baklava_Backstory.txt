Draco Baklava, the Dragonborn Ranger

Backstory:

Draco Baklava was born into a small Dragonborn community nestled in the wilderness, far from the bustling cities and civilized realms. As a child, Draco showed a deep connection to the natural world, spending hours observing the creatures and plants that surrounded him. 
In his adolescence, Draco embarked on his first solo adventure into the wilderness. He sought to prove himself and deepen his understanding of nature. During his journey, he encountered a ferocious beast that threatened his life. Acting on instinct, Draco tapped into his dragon heritage and unleashed a powerful acid breath weapon, subduing the creature. It was in this moment that he realized the true strength and potential within him. He could kill if he so desired, or he could control his acid breath and use it like a paralyzing agent.

With newfound confidence and a desire to protect the natural world, Draco became an outlander, venturing into the uncharted territories beyond his homeland. His travels took him through dense forests, treacherous mountains, and untamed wilderness, where he honed his skills as a ranger. Draco's survival abilities were matched only by his devotion to the balance and harmony of nature.

However, Draco's path was not without hardships. Throughout his journeys, he suffered recurring visions of a looming catastrophe that threatened to engulf the world. These visions haunted his dreams, filling him with a sense of urgency and responsibility. Determined to prevent this disaster, Draco swore to dedicate his life to preserving the natural order and punishing those who would seek to harm it.

Despite his noble intentions, Draco carried within him a deep-seated resentment toward those who had seriously wronged him in the past. He remembered every insult, every act of disrespect, and nursed a silent grudge against those individuals. While he strived to embody the ideals of chaotic good, his personal vendettas sometimes clouded his judgment, pushing him closer to the edge of his moral compass.
