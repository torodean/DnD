Lorelei Blackthorn, a former circus acrobat and now a rogue charlatan, was born into a family of traveling carnival performers known as The Moonlight Carnival. From a young age, she was immersed and trained in a world of magic performances, acrobatics.

Her fate took an unexpected turn when a tragic event happened when she was a teen, caused by sabotage from malicious rivals, where lives of loved ones were lost. Since then, the remaining members of the troupe disbanded and Lorelei found herself abandoned, lost without purpose and not quite fitting in with regular people. 

Having no one to trust, she did what she needed to do to survive and make a living as a professional con artist and a bounty hunter. She finds herself teetering on the line between hero and anti-hero because of her desire for revenge and also her motivation to find a new community she can trust and live an honest life.
