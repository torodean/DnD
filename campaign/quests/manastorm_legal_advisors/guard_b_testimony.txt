Guard Testimony - Perspective of Guard B

I, Guard B, hereby provide my testimony regarding the events that unfolded during our fateful journey alongside Milton Manastorm, the ambassador, and the mysterious artifact. It is with a heavy heart that I recount the suspicious actions and unsettling behaviors displayed by Milton, leading us to question his true intentions.

Before we embarked on our perilous journey, the ambassador, a figure of great wisdom and discernment, warned us about Milton. The ambassador expressed doubts about his trustworthiness, casting a shadow of suspicion over our companion from the very beginning.

As our expedition progressed, it became increasingly evident that Milton possessed an uncanny familiarity with the terrain and an innate ability to navigate the challenges that lay before us. His knowledge of the surroundings and his swift solutions to obstacles raised eyebrows among the guards, hinting at a level of preparation that seemed all too convenient.

The true test of our mettle came when a colossal and fearsome beast, unlike anything we had ever encountered, emerged from the shadows. This creature, a dark and malevolent entity with two heads, one adorned with a single glowing eye and the other with razor-sharp teeth, presented a formidable challenge to our party. We valiantly engaged the beast, risking life and limb to protect the ambassador and the precious artifact.

Amidst the chaos of the battle, Milton, with a calculated air of confidence, produced a strange device known as the nexus. With a swift motion, he activated it, channeling its power to transform the ambassador into a helpless chicken. Without hesitation, Milton cast the avian form of the ambassador and the artifact into the depths of the nexus device.

As the energy surged through the device, a palpable shockwave rippled through the air, affecting not only the ambassador but also the formidable beast. It was at this critical juncture that Milton, peering into the device, muttered words that sent a chill down my spine: "They're gone." The sinister implication of his statement hung heavy in the air, suggesting a deliberate intention to rid himself of the ambassador and the artifact.

Almost immediately, the mist that had enshrouded us began to dissipate, revealing a creature that seemed to lighten in color as the fog lifted. The great beast, weakened by the nexus's energy surge, retaliated with one final mighty blow, rendering Milton unconscious.

As the mist continued to dissipate, the beast itself transformed into a petrified statue, leaving us astonished by the strange turn of events. With the ambassador and the artifact nowhere to be found, suspicion fell upon Milton. We, the guards, seized the opportunity to apprehend him and return to the city, where he could be questioned and held accountable for his actions.

During the subsequent interrogation, Milton professed uncertainty regarding his ability to retrieve the ambassador or the artifact, further deepening the doubts surrounding his true motives. His lack of assurance, coupled with the sequence of events that unfolded, led us to believe that he had orchestrated a scheme to obtain the artifact for his personal gain.

I present this testimony as a testament to the suspicions and concerns that arose from Milton's actions throughout our ill-fated journey. His foreknowledge of the terrain, the calculated use of the nexus device, and his muttered words hinting at intentional loss cast a shadow over his intentions. The absence of the ambassador and the artifact, combined with Milton's uncertainty, only solidify our belief that he sought to seize the artifact for his own purposes.

May this account contribute to a thorough investigation that unravels the truth behind Milton Manastorm's motives and ensures justice is served for those affected by his actions.
