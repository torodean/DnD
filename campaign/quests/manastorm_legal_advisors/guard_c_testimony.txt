Guard Testimony - Perspective of Guard C

I, Guard C, provide my testimony regarding the events that transpired during our ill-fated expedition alongside Milton Manastorm, the ambassador, and the enigmatic artifact. As a witness to the unfolding events, I recount my observations and share my suspicions surrounding Milton's actions, which added to the growing doubt surrounding his true motives.

Prior to our journey, the ambassador, a figure revered for their wisdom, expressed reservations about placing trust in Milton. Their cautionary words echoed in my mind as we embarked on our treacherous adventure, heightening my vigilance regarding Milton's every move.

As we ventured forth into the unknown, it became apparent that Milton possessed an uncanny familiarity with the terrain and an intimate knowledge of how to overcome the challenges that awaited us. His seemingly effortless navigation through treacherous landscapes and adeptness at circumventing obstacles raised eyebrows among the guards, leaving us questioning the true extent of his involvement and motives.

Our journey took a harrowing turn when a fearsome creature, a dark entity with two heads—a single, piercing glowing eye on one and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth on the other—emerged from the shadows, exuding an aura of malevolence. Engulfed by an instinctive need to protect the ambassador and safeguard the artifact, we braced ourselves for the battle that lay ahead.

In the midst of the relentless clash against the monstrous beast, Milton abruptly produced a peculiar device known as the nexus. Swiftly activating it, he harnessed its mystical power to transform the ambassador into an inconspicuous chicken, a bewildering act that left us questioning his true intentions.

Without hesitation, Milton tossed the transformed ambassador and the artifact into the depths of the nexus device. As the energy surged through the device, an unsettling shockwave rippled through the air, affecting not only the ambassador but also the formidable creature we faced. In that critical moment, I distinctly recall Milton peering into the device, his lips forming the words, "They're gone," his tone laced with a hint of satisfaction that sent shivers down my spine.

Almost immediately, the mist that had engulfed us began to dissipate, unveiling a creature whose dark, shadowy form seemed to lighten as the fog lifted. The once-intimidating beast, now weakened by the nexus's surge of energy, unleashed one final mighty blow upon Milton, rendering him unconscious.

As the mist continued to fade, the monstrous creature itself gradually transformed into a motionless statue, a haunting sight that left us grappling with the eerie aftermath. With the ambassador and the artifact conspicuously absent, suspicion loomed over Milton. As guards, we seized the opportunity to apprehend him, returning to the city with Milton in custody, where he could face further questioning and accountability for his actions.

During subsequent interrogations, Milton's uncertainty regarding the retrieval of the ambassador and the artifact only served to deepen our doubts about his true intentions. The sequence of events, coupled with his familiarity with the terrain, his calculated use of the nexus device, and his disturbing utterance upon peering inside, left us with a lingering suspicion that Milton had orchestrated this entire affair to secure the artifact for his personal gain.

I present this testimony as a reflection of the doubts and concerns that arose from my firsthand experiences alongside Milton Manastorm. While I acknowledge the similarities to the testimony of Guard B, these shared observations serve to corroborate the underlying suspicions surrounding Milton's motives. Together, these accounts underscore the need for a thorough investigation that uncovers the truth behind his actions and ensures justice for all those affected.

May my testimony contribute to shedding light on the perplexing circumstances surrounding Milton Manastorm, ultimately leading to the resolution of this intricate and distressing affair.
