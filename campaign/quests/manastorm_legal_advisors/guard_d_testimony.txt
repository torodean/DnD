Guard Testimony - Perspective of Guard D

I, Guard D, hereby provide my account of the tumultuous events that unfolded during our ill-fated expedition alongside Milton Manastorm, the ambassador, and the mysterious artifact. As a guard primarily focused on combat, my attention was consumed by the battle with the monstrous creature, leaving me with a limited perspective on Milton's actions. Nonetheless, I can provide key details that corroborate the sequence of events and the mounting suspicions surrounding Milton's involvement.

Before embarking on our perilous journey, the ambassador's cautionary words regarding Milton's trustworthiness lingered in the back of my mind. While my primary focus was on the physical defense of our group, I couldn't shake the subtle doubt that crept in whenever I observed Milton's demeanor and actions.

As we ventured through treacherous terrains and encountered numerous obstacles, Milton's unwavering confidence and seemingly innate understanding of the environment raised eyebrows among the guards, including myself. While my attention was primarily directed towards ensuring the safety of our party during combat encounters, I couldn't help but notice Milton's proficiency in navigating the terrain, leading us to question the true extent of his knowledge and motives.

The defining moment of our journey arrived when a menacing beast, a creature adorned with two heads—one possessing a luminous eye while the other showcased a set of menacing teeth—emerged from the shadows. Engaged in an intense battle for our lives, my focus was firmly fixed on engaging the creature, leaving little room for close observation of Milton's specific actions.

However, amid the chaos of the confrontation, I distinctly recall Milton producing a peculiar device, which he activated with precision. In the heat of battle, his swift maneuver caught my attention, but my primary concern remained on fending off the relentless assault from the creature. I did not witness the exact moment when the ambassador was transformed into a chicken, but I noticed Milton casting the transformed figure into the depths of the nexus device.

The device itself emitted a surge of energy, causing a ripple effect that appeared to affect both the creature and the surrounding mist. Though I cannot attest to the specifics of Milton's mutterings or his exact expression upon looking into the device, I sensed an air of unease and concern within his demeanor. The subsequent dissipation of the mist and the creature's apparent weakening further hinted at the nexus device's influence over our surroundings.

In the midst of this commotion, the incapacitating blow that Milton suffered rendered him unconscious, leaving him vulnerable and at the mercy of our foe. As the mist cleared and the creature itself solidified into a motionless statue, the realization struck that both the ambassador and the artifact were absent from our midst. This revelation only deepened the growing suspicions surrounding Milton's involvement in their disappearance.

Subsequent events led to Milton's apprehension and our return to the city, where he could face further inquiry and judgment for his actions. While my firsthand observations were primarily focused on the intense combat and ensuring the safety of our group, I acknowledge the shared testimonies of my fellow guards, who have provided more detailed accounts of Milton's specific actions and utterances.

I present this testimony as a testament to the events I witnessed and the mounting doubts surrounding Milton Manastorm. Although my focus on combat limited my direct insights into his actions, the similarities to the testimonies of my fellow guards serve to corroborate the overarching narrative and raise justifiable concerns regarding Milton's true intentions.

May this account contribute to the collective understanding of the perplexing circumstances surrounding Milton Manastorm, ultimately aiding in the pursuit of truth and justice for all those affected by this unsettling ordeal.
