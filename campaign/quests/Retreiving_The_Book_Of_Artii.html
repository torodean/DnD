    This quest involves the task of retrieving

    <a href="../characters/non-player/milton_manastorm.html">
     milton manastorm
    </a>
    was initially assigned to retrieve it. Milton managed to track the book to
    <a href="../locations/cities/Vifavea/Vifavea.html">
     Vifavea</a>, but communication with him was lost shortly after. Milton found himself in a jail cell after causing trouble. The players are now tasked with traveling to

     Vifavea
    </a>
    to find

    and acquire

    . Before his capture, Milton had arranged to receive the book from his contact at The Salty Seahorse Inn. However, he was ambushed just outside the inn by members of
    <a href="../lore/guilds/The_Council_of_Shadows.html">
     The Council of Shadows</a>, who took the book. In the chaos, Milton caused quite a bit of damage to the Inn - which is what landed him in jail. Milton, knowledgeable about

     The Council of Shadows</a>, is aware that they have a hidden underground base beneath the
    <a href="../locations/cities/Vifavea/Vifavea.html">
     Vifavea
    </a>
    Mansion. He does not know how to access this base. The players must infiltrate this base and retrieve
